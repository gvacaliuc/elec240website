\#\#\# ELEC 240 Lab \# Introduction In Lab 3 we saw that the voltage
divider was an attenuator:
\$v\_\\text{out} = \\frac{R\_2}{R\_1 + R\_2} v\_\\text{in} = G
v\_\\text{in}\$
where \$G \\le 1\$. If we had a box where \$v\_{out} = G v\_{in}\$ with
\$G&gt;1\$ we would have an \*amplifier\*. To be more precise, we would
have a \*non-inverting\*, \*voltage\* amplifier. If \$G &lt; -1\$, we
would still be increasing the magnitude of the signal, but would change
its sign. This is called an \*inverting\* amplifier. We could also have
a \*current amplifier\* where \$i\_\\text{out} = G\_i i\_\\text{in}\$.
Circuits containing only resistors, capacitors, and inductors (e.g.
attenuators or RC filters) are \*passive\*. An amplifier is an
\*active\* circuit element; it delivers more power to its load than it
receives from its source. (In fact this additional power comes from an
external power supply, so no laws of physics are being violated, but
when we're drawing circuit diagrams we usually draw only the amplifier
and ignore the power supply.)
