Up to now we've been building fairly simple circuits, measuring
them, and taking them apart.
This week we will begin building simple subsystems, some of which
we will want to use in subsequent labs.
Although as subsystems they are simple, as circuits they are
quite a bit more complex than those we've built so far,
and wiring them will require a bit more thought on how the
components should be laid out and connected on the breadboard.
You should look over the section on organizing your breadboard
and develop a plan of attack for this week's session.
Also,
since you have several op-amps in your parts kit,
you could
save some time by
wiring up all (or several) of this week's circuits before coming
to lab.
