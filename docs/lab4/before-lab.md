ELEC 240 Lab

Before Lab
==========

Up to now we've been building fairly simple circuits, measuring them, and
taking them apart. This week we will begin building simple subsystems, some of
which we will want to use in subsequent labs.  Although as subsystems they are
simple, as circuits they are quite a bit more complex than those we've built so
far, and wiring them will require a bit more thought on how the components 
should be laid out and connected on the breadboard. You should look over the
section on organizing your breadboard and develop a plan of attack for this
week's session.
