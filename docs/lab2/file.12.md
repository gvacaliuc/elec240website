In Lab 1,
the signals we observed were simple,
and their sources assumed to be ideal.
Similarly, we assumed that the measuring instrument had no effect
on the signal source.

Real signal sources and destinations
are not ideal, but rather have a resistance associated with them,
as shown in the diagram below.
For resons which will soon become apparent,
it's common to refer to the destination of a signal as the
<em>load</em>.

Ordinarily we assume that $R_{out}$ is negligibly small (e.g. $0$)
and that $R_{L}$ is extremely high (e.g. $\infty$).
This assumption usually works
but sometimes fails, causing
&quot;anomalous results".
