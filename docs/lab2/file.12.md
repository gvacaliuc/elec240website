Background
==========

In Lab 1, the signals we observed were simple, and their sources assumed
to be ideal. Similarly, we assumed that the measuring instrument had no
effect on the signal source. Real signal sources and destinations are
not ideal, but rather have a resistance associated with them, as shown
in the diagram below. For resons which will soon become apparent, it's
common to refer to the destination of a signal as the *load*.

Ordinarily we assume that \$R\_{out}\$ is negligibly small (e.g. \$0\$)
and that \$R\_{L}\$ is extremely high (e.g. \$\\infty\$). This
assumption usually works but sometimes fails, causing "anomalous
results".
