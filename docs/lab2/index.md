So far we have looked only at electrical signals.
Our communication system will require us to be able to
translate the information being sent between various forms:
acoustical, electrical, and optical.
Components which perform these transformations are called
<em>transducers</em>.
This week we will examine some of the transducers we will
use in subsequent labs.
