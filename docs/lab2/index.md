Laboratory 2
============

Signal Sources and Sinks
========================

So far we have looked only at electrical signals. Our communication
system will require us to be able to translate the information being
sent between various forms: acoustical, electrical, and optical.
Components which perform these transformations are called *transducers*.
This week we will examine some of the transducers we will use in
subsequent labs.
