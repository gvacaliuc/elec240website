Pin Connections and the Interface Module
========================================

[]() The path from the instruments to the breadboard is provided by the
*Interface Module*. This is a printed circuit board with a variety of
different connectors and two short, single-row socket strips.

These are like the socket strips on the breadboard (five points
connected together) except that instead of being connected just to
themselves, the pins are also connected to the other connectors on the
board.

[]() Here's a closeup of the two halves of the socket strip (shown
separately to fit the page better):
