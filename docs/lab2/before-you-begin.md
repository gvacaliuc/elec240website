ELEC 240 Lab

Before You Begin
================

Last week we were able to use banana and BNC patch cords to make the
connections we required. The components we will be using this week don't have
banana or BNC connectors. Instead we will be using the *breadboard* and
*interface modules* to make connections.

You should carefully study the workings of the breadboard and interface modules
in the [Lab Station Handbook](../lab-report)) first.
