Last week we were able to use banana and BNC patch cords to make the
connections we required.
The components we will be using this week don't have banana
or BNC connectors.
Instead we will be using the
<em>breadboard</em>
and <em>interface modules</em>
to make connections.
<p>
You should carefully study the workings of the breadboard and interface modules in the <a name=Lab Station Handbook href=/chapter2>Lab Station Handbook</a>) first.
