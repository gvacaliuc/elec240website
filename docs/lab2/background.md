Background
==========

In Lab 1, the signals we observed were simple, and their sources assumed to be
ideal. Similarly, we assumed that the measuring instrument had no effect on the
signal source. Real signal sources and destinations are not ideal, but rather
have a resistance associated with them, as shown in the diagram below. For
resons which will soon become apparent, it's common to refer to the destination
of a signal as the *load*.

Ordinarily we assume that $R_{out}$ is negligibly small (e.g. $0$) and that
$R_{L}$ is extremely high (e.g. $\infty$). This assumption usually works but
sometimes fails, causing "anomalous results".
