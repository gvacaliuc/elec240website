ELEC 240 Lab

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Introduction

In this lab, you will be working **individually.** This lab introduces you to
basic soldering techniques. Because there is some safety and technical training
involved, you are required to attend a lab session to start work on your
soldering project. After that, you may come in on your own time to finish up
your project if needed, provided you agree to follow correct safety procedures.
