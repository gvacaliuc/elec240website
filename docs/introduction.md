ELEC 240 Lab

Introduction
============

Welcome to the ELEC 240 Lab, the real world companion to the ELEC 241
lectures.

### The Grand Plan

We have a number of lofty goals for this lab. Our ultimate goal is the
transmission and processing of information and our vehicle for that
information will be the signal. Along the way we will study how signals
carry information, how they arise in circuits and systems, how to
characterize them, and how they interact with the components that make
up information systems. Finally we will give you a chance to do what
engineers do: to put it all together in the design, construction, and
analysis of a biosignals measurement system.

### The Laboratory Schedule

Here's what we have to do:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

|   Week 5  |   Lab 3: Passive Circuits |
|   Week 6  |   Lab 4: Active Circuits |
|   Week 7  |   Lab 5: Active Circuits, cont'd. |
|   Week 8  |   Lab 6: Signal Analysis and Characterization |
|   Week 9  |   Lab 7: Digital Signal Processing |
|   Week 10 |   Lab 8: Soldering Basics |
|   Week 11 |   Lab 9: Digital Logic Circuits |
|   Week 12 |   Lab 10: Bioelectrical Signals |

### Lab Groups

In lab (and outside lab as well) you will work in a team of two people,
and responsibilities should be shared among both members. Lab grades
will be given on a per group basis, rather than individually.
