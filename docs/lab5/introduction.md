Introduction
============

This week we are going to take a break from circuits (well, almost) and spend
our time looking more closely at signals. We already have a number of
parameters to characterize simple, periodic signals, such as amplitude, period,
and waveshape. But we need a way to describe more complex signals, both
periodic and non-periodic, other than by drawing pictures of them. The way we
will do that is by Fourier analysis, specifically the *Fourier Transform*.

The formula for the Fourier Transform has an elegant simplicity to it, but
actually trying to evaluate it, for other than very simple signals, is an
exercise in extreme computation. Fortunately, computation is what computers
excel at, so we will use our Lab PC to compute the Fourier Transform with a
software called Labview.
