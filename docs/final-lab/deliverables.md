ELEC 240 Lab

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Deliverables

To complete this lab, you need to develop 4 things:

* a working EMG device
* a polished Labview interface
* a lab report
* a product demo

where the device is described in the [Project
Specification](./project-specification) and the rest are described below.


### Labview Interface

The Labview interface can be as detailed as you like but the minimum
requirements are:

1. User-friendly look

2. Time-domain waveform with averaging capability (for smoother waveform).

3. Voltage threshold indication

4. Frequency-domain waveform with information on what frequencies are being
   seen

5. Additional filtering ability (500Hz LPF)

### Final Report and Demo

After you have created your working EMG, write up a lab report (in the same
format as previous lab reports) and submit one final report per lab group.

You will also schedule a 5-min demo for the last week of classes. Walk us
through the design, the Labview interface, any problems you encountered, and be
ready to answer a few questions about your project.
