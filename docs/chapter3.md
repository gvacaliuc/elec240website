Chapter 3

Tools and Resources
</h1>
</center>
If you look over the labs we have planned,
it's clear that there's a considerable amount of
work to be done.
Fortunately we have a substantial collection of tools
available to make this an efficient process.
These include the materials used to build the circuits,
tools to assemble them,
instruments to analyze them,
data analysis software, and of course documentation.
<p>
In this chapter we will take a brief inventory of the tools
and resources we have available.
A complete list, with more detailed descriptions,
is contained in
<i>The UNILAB User's Manual</i>.
<p>
<h3>Instruments</h3>
<p>
Each station is equipped with a VirtualBench, which will work as
power supply, oscilloscope, and function generator.
It will also work as a digitial multimeter (DMM), but a handheld digital multimeter is available for each station, kept in the equipment room.
<h3>Components</h3>
<p>
Each lab group will get a kit containing an assortment of resistors,
capacitors, and semiconductors.
These should be sufficient to build all the circuits we will study
this semester, but if not additional components are available in
the equipment room.
Larger components,
such as microphones, speakers, handsets, etc.,
are also kept in the equipment room,
and must be left there between lab sessions, as we only
have enough for each day's lab groups.
Do not keep equipment such as microphones in your locker!
<h3>Interconnects</h3>
There are two kinds of things we will need to connect:
components to each other to make circuits
and instruments to circuits (and to each other) to measure signals.
<dl>
<dt><b>Patch Cords</b><dd>
Patch cords are lengths of cable a foot or so long with a connector
on each end.
We have two kinds:
with
<a name=banana plugs href=figs/banana.jpg>banana plugs</a>
for connecting to the power supply and DMM,
and with
<a name=BNC connectors href=figs/bnc.jpg>BNC connectors</a>
for connecting to the oscilloscope and function generator.
We also have
<a name=BNC clip leads href=figs/clip_leads.jpg>BNC clip leads</a>
for connecting instruments
directly to components,
but the interface module provides an easier way to do this
in most cases.
<dt><b>The Breadboard</b><dd>
Each lab group will be issued a breadboard
and interface board.
You may take these home with you between labs, or leave them in
the equipment room, as you choose.
In any event, place a label (also available in the equipment room)
with the names of your group members and your lab day on the
underside of the breadboard and on the back side of the interface
board.
The breadboard and interface board must be returned, in usable
condition, at the end of the semester.

<h3>Tool Kit</h3>
<p>
Each student will be
given
a kit containing
tools that will be useful in building circuits
in the lab.
It includes
wire cutters, wire strippers, needle nose pliers,
a chip puller, and a small screwdriver for adjusting trimpots.
It also includes a BNC T connector and banana plug adapter
for making interconnections with patch cords.
These tools will be useful in several of your other lab
courses, so try to hang onto them.
<h3>Lab PC</h3>
<p>
Each lab station has a Dell DX280 PC running Windows XP.
It is connected to the network
so you may access your OwlSpace directory and your favorite web sites.
In addition to the regular complement of features
it contains a
<em>data acquisition</em>
card,
allowing it to measure and produce signals
in the circuits you will be building.
Networked printing is available from the printer (printer name &quot;ink")
in the equipment room (A143).
