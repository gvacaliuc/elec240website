A patch cord is a length of cable with a connector on each end.
We have two different types:
banana plug patch cords to connect the DC Power Supply to the
breadboard
and BNC patch cords to connect the other instruments
to each other and to the breadboard interface module.
<p>
There are two accessories to increase the flexibility of the
patch cords: the BNC to banana adapter and the BNC T connector.
The
<a name=BNC to banana plug adapter href=/misc_images/#banana-adapter>BNC to banana plug adapter</a>
allows a BNC cable to be connected
to a pair of banana jacks.
Note the ground bump on one side of the adapter; this denotes
which banana plug prong is connected to the outer (ground) conductor
of the BNC connector.
The
<a name=BNC T connector href=/misc_images/#bnc-t>BNC T connector</a>
allows two BNC cables to be plugged into the same
connector.
<p>
There are two dedicated cables that connect the
Lab PC to the breadboard.
One has several phone plugs on one end to plug into the
sound card and an 8-pin DIN connector to plug into J2-1 of
the interface module.
The other is a 50-pin ribbon cable to connect the interface
module to the data acquisition card.
