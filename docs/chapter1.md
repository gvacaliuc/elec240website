<p>
Welcome to the ELEC 240 Lab, the real world companion to the
ELEC 241 lectures.

<h3>The Grand Plan</h3>
<p>
We have a number of lofty goals for this lab.
Our ultimate goal
is the transmission and processing of information and
our
vehicle for that information
will be
the signal.
Along the way we
will study how signals carry information,
how they arise in circuits and systems,
how to characterize them,
and how they interact with the components that make up
information systems.
Finally we will give you a chance to
do what engineers do:
to put it all together
in the design, construction, and analysis
of a biosignals measurement system.

<h3>Lab Groups</h3>
<p>
In lab (and outside lab as well) you will work in a team
of two people, and responsibilities should be shared
among both members.
Lab grades will be given on a per group basis,
rather than individually.
