<p>Experiment 8</p>
<p>Introduction to Soldering</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In this lab, you will be working <strong>individually.</strong> This lab introduces you to basic soldering techniques. Because there is some safety and technical training involved, you are required to attend a lab session to start work on your soldering project. After that, you may come in on your own time to finish up your project if needed, provided you agree to follow correct safety procedures.</p>
<p>Equipment</p>
<p>Velleman soldering kit of your choice</p>
<p>Hakko soldering iron</p>
<p>Rosic core solder</p>
<p>Wire stripper/cutter</p>
<p>Desoldering wick</p>
<p>Third hand PCB clamp</p>
<p>Bending tools (pliers, x-mas tree)</p>
<p>Safety glasses</p>
<p>Flux</p>
<p>Multimeter</p>
<p>Water squeeze bottle</p>
<p>Procedure</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Pick a Velleman soldering kit from the options provided you in lab.</p></li>
<li><p>Pull out the instructions manual of your kit and take a moment to ensure all the parts are included. You can also find the instructions online at <a href="http://www.velleman.eu">www.velleman.eu</a>, by searching for your kit part number.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow along and participate in the in-class lab training.</p></li>
<li><p>Begin on your soldering kit when instructed to do so, following the step-by-step instructions for your kit.</p></li>
<li><p>Once completed, demonstrate your soldering skills and functional gadget to a labbie or instructor and get it signed off on the form below.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean up after yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Write up a lab report (LaTEX not required for this one) that includes the following sections:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Introduction</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>Purpose of lab</p></li>
<li><p>Description of what your gadget is supposed to do</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Procedure. Provide a general methodology for soldering a pcb (in list format), as if you were training someone else to solder. Include some safety tips, clever techniques, etc. that you picked up from your own experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Results</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>Does your gadget work? If not, why not?</p></li>
<li><p>Schematic description. Take a look at the schematic of your gadget (provided in the instructions manual) and “reverse engineer” how it works. You may need to look up part numbers of components online and understand what each component does.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Conclusions</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>What did you learn from this lab (include new things learned, and mistakes you learned from)?</p></li>
<li><p>What would you do differently next time?</p></li>
<li><p>Any additional feedback on this lab?</p></li>
