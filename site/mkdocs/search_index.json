            "text": "ELEC 240 Lab\n\n\n\n\nThe Breadboard\n\n\nThe Concept\n\n\nWhen building a \"permanent circuit\" the components can be \"grown\" together (as\nin an integrated circuit), soldered together (as on a printed circuit board),\nor held together by screws and clamps (as in house wiring). In lab, we want\nsomething that is easy to assemble and easy to change. We also want something\nthat can be used with the same components that \"real\" circuits use. Most of\nthese components have pieces of wire or metal tabs sticking out of them to form\ntheir terminals.\n\n\nHow it Works\n\n\nThe heart of the solderless breadboard is a small metal clip that looks like\nthis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of the pairs of fingers is mechanically independent from the others, so we\ncan insert the end of a wire between any pair without reducing the tension in\nany of the other fingers. However when we insert a wire between any pair, we\nelectrically connect all metal fingers together.\n\n\nTo make a breadboard, an array of these clips is embedded in a plastic block\nwhich holds them in place and insulates them from each other, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the size and arrangement of the clips, we get either a socket\nstrip or a bus strip. The socket strip is used for connecting components\ntogether. It has two rows of short (5 contact) clips arranged one above\nanother, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bus strip is used to distribute power and ground voltages through the\ncircuit. It has has six long (24 contact) clips arranged lengthwise, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the bus strip is not electrically connected in the center. If you\nwant a single, continuous bus, you will have to bridge that central gap\nyourself.\n\n\nWhen we combine two socket strips, three bus strips, power connectors, power\ntie points, interface modules, and an interface connector on a large printed\ncircuit board, we get the complete breadboard:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In this picture we have replaced the plastic covers, hiding the connection\nbetween the terminal points).\n\n\nThe breadboard lets us connect components together and by wiring the bus strips\nto the binding posts and the binding posts to the power supply, to connect the\npower supply to the circuit. Now what we need is a way to bring connections\nfrom the rest of the instruments into the breadboard.",

            "text": "The heart of the solderless breadboard is a small metal clip that looks like\nthis:     Each of the pairs of fingers is mechanically independent from the others, so we\ncan insert the end of a wire between any pair without reducing the tension in\nany of the other fingers. However when we insert a wire between any pair, we\nelectrically connect all metal fingers together.  To make a breadboard, an array of these clips is embedded in a plastic block\nwhich holds them in place and insulates them from each other, like this:     Depending on the size and arrangement of the clips, we get either a socket\nstrip or a bus strip. The socket strip is used for connecting components\ntogether. It has two rows of short (5 contact) clips arranged one above\nanother, like this:     The bus strip is used to distribute power and ground voltages through the\ncircuit. It has has six long (24 contact) clips arranged lengthwise, like this:     Note that the bus strip is not electrically connected in the center. If you\nwant a single, continuous bus, you will have to bridge that central gap\nyourself.  When we combine two socket strips, three bus strips, power connectors, power\ntie points, interface modules, and an interface connector on a large printed\ncircuit board, we get the complete breadboard:     (In this picture we have replaced the plastic covers, hiding the connection\nbetween the terminal points).  The breadboard lets us connect components together and by wiring the bus strips\nto the binding posts and the binding posts to the power supply, to connect the\npower supply to the circuit.

We will use only one or two of the interface components at a time\nand will build circuits consisting of 2 or 3 components which are disassembled\nat the end of lab. As we get closer to the final project, we will be\nconstructing more complicated circuits having more external connections. Since\nsome of these will perform functions needed in subsequent Labs, we will want to\nleave them in place on the breadboard for future use. We will need a plan for\norganizing the layout and wiring on the breadboard and interface board.\n\n\nThere are several aspects to this organization ranging from small details to\nthe big picture.\n\n\nColor Coding\n\n\nYour wire kit contains an assortment of different colored wires. You could just\npick pieces of wire at random, or you could try to use the different colors to\ndesignate different signals. There aren't enough colors for each signal to have\nits own, but you can use different colors to denote different classes of\nsignals.\n\n\nOne set of signals you should color code are power and ground. In particular,\nyou should have a different color for \n\\(+15V\\)\n, \n\\(-15V\\)\n, and ground. You should\nnot use any of these colors for other signals. It would be nice to use\n\"standard\" colors for these, but unfortunately there are several competing\nstandards. One color that nearly everyone agrees on is that red should be the\npositive power supply voltage. Most automotive and electronic wiring uses black\nto denote ground. Electronic wiring which uses black for ground often uses blue\nfor the negative supply. However, our power supply and breadboard use green to\ndenote ground (the convention used in house wiring) and use black to denote the\nnegative supply.\n\n\nSo we have two possible \"standard\" color codes for power: \n\n\n\n\nred\u00a0=\u00a0+, green\u00a0=\u00a0gnd, black\u00a0=\u00a0-\n\n\nred\u00a0=\u00a0+, black\u00a0=\u00a0gnd, blue\u00a0=\u00a0- \n\n\n\n\nYou could use either of these, or make up your own.\n\n\nAnother useful thing to color code would be the wires or \"probes\" from the\ninterface board connector. That way you can tell which wire is \nCH1\n of the\nscope or which is the function generator output without having to trace from\none end of the wire to the other.\n\n\nPower Bussing\n\n\nThere are a few different ways to figure out the orientation of an Integrated\nChip (IC) such as an an \nop-amp\n.  The first step\nis to figure out where pin 1 is. The remaining pins are in chronological order\nand increment in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n\nIf pin 1 is in the lower left corner, then the writing on the package reads\nleft to right. Alternately, some ICs will have a dot above pin 1.  A third\nindication is a semi-circle indentation on the top end of the chip - pin 1 will\nbe to the left of it.\n\n\nTo simplify power wiring, we should run the positive bus above each socket\nstrip and the negative bus below. Doing this and running ground on the\nremaining buses gives us the following layout for power:\n\n\n\n\nInterface Board Connector Assignments\n\n\nSome of the connectors on the Interface Board are dedicated to a single\nfunction (e.g. the telephone handset or the sound card). Others (e.g.\nthe BNC and phone jacks) are more flexible and may be connected to a\nvariety of signal sources or destinations. It will be helpful to\nestablish standard assignments for these connectors as well.\n\n\nIn the instructions and photographs, we will be using the following\nassignment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnector\n\n\nSocket Pin\n\n\nSignal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ1-1\n\n\n1\n\n\nOscilloscope channel 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ1-2\n\n\n2\n\n\nOscilloscope channel 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ1-3\n\n\n3\n\n\nFunction generator output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall Layout\n\n\nThis final project will be a fairly complex circuit. Good engineering practice\nis to break down a complex system into a number of simple subsystems, each of\nwhich performs a single, well-defined function.\n\n\nIn the unlikely event that your circuit does not work perfectly the first time\nyou turn it on, it will make it easier for you (and your labbie) to debug it if\neach of these subcircuits is laid out (neatly, of course) on its own little\npatch of breadboard and is connected to the other subcircuits in such a way\nthat it may be easilly disconnected from them for testing in isolation.\n\n\nOne additional advantage of a tidy layout with short wires is that it is more\nrugged. Remember that you will have to transport your circuit from your lab\nbench to the testing station without parts falling off or loops of wire getting\ncaught and mysteriously pulled loose.\n\n\nReal World Circuit Problems\n\n\nOn paper all our components are ideal and no components exist where we don't\ndraw them. In an actual circuit, things are not quite so tidy: wires have non\nzero resistance and inductance, sources have output resistance, parasitic\ncapacitances and mutual inductances exist between wires, and a host of other\ngremlins. In addition, although we are only applying input signals up to a few\n10s of kHz, the active devices (op amps and transistors) we use have gain at\nfrequencies up to a few MHz (op amps) or 100s of MHz (transistors). This means\nthat all of the \"little\" pieces of wire can become fairly effective antennas,\nradiating energy to (and receiving from) the rest of the world, and more\nsignificantly, to other parts of the circuit.\n\n\nWhat all this means is that a circuit which is wired correctly topologically\nmay fail to function as expected. Although we can't eliminate all of these\neffects, we can do some things to minimize them.  Here are a few.\n\n\nLayout\n\n\nTry to arrange your layout so that each function is grouped together in a\nsingle area of the board and so that stages that are connected together are\nclose to each other. This will allow connections to be made with shorter wires.\nAlso try to avoid having high level signals near low level stages.\n\n\nTwisted Pairs\n\n\nOne way to reduce unwanted coupling between different signals in your circuit\nis to use \ntwisted pairs\n, i.e. a pair of wires twisted together with one wire\nconnected to ground and the other carrying the signal.\n\n\nTo make a twisted pair, select two wires having an aesthetically pleasing\ncombination of colors and twist them together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could use twisted pair wires for connections between the interface board\nand your circuit, as well as any other long runs of wire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse one wire for the signal and connect the other to ground, at both ends of\nthe run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome signals (e.g. the photodiode input) don't have a ground. In this case, you\ncan still use a twisted pair, but neither wire will be grounded.\n\n\nRouting\n\n\nTwisted pair or not, try to keep wires carrying high level signals (large\nvoltages or currents) (e.g. the LED or earphone) away from those carrying low\nlevel signals (e.g. the photodiode or dynamic microphone).  A corollary to this\nis to keep outputs away from inputs, especially in the same subcircuit. It's\nbetter for wires to cross at right angles than to run parallel to each other.\n\n\nBypass Capacitors\n\n\nAnother path for unwanted coupling between stages is via the power supply. To\nreduce this, use some of your electrolytic capacitors as \nbypass capacitors\n,\ni.e. connect them between the power supply voltages and ground (be sure to\nobserve correct polarity on the electrolytic capacitors - the shorter wire is\nusually negative polarity, and you will also see a neg sign above this wire).\nIdeally each op amp should be bypassed, but you may be able to get by with a\nsingle pair of capacitors for the entire circuit.\n\n\nWiring Technique\n\n\nThe basic idea of wiring on a solderless breadboard is simple: just stick the\nends of the component leads or wires into the holes. But like any seemingly\nsimple process, there are a few subtleties that can make the difference between\nsuccess and failure.\n\n\nFirst a note of caution. The material that the clips inside the breadboard are\nmade of (so called \"nickel silver\") is a compromise between good conductivity,\ncorrosion resistance, and springiness. In particular the elastic limit is\nconsiderably less than of a good steel spring and if spread too far, can be\npermanently distorted. To avoid deforming the connector clips:\n\n\n\n\nUse only the wire that is supplied to you (24 gauge, solid\n  telephone cable).\n\n\nUse only components with small diameter leads (1/4 watt resistors,\n  capacitors, ICs, etc.).\n\n\nDo not insert power resistor leads into the breadboard.  When using power\n\n\ntransistors in the breadboard, use your pliers to\n  twist each lead 90 degrees so that they are gripped by the broad face rather\n  than the narrow edge.\n\n\nNever insert more than one wire in a hole.\n\n\n\n\nWith the health of our breadboard assured, there are a few more things we can\ndo to make sure that our connections are good ones.\n\n\n\n\nStrip about 7\u00a0mm of insulation from each end of a piece of wire.\n  Less than that raises the risk that insulation will be forced between the\n  fingers of the clip. More leaves bare wire exposed that can short to adjacent\n  components. Don't try to jam the wires far down into the breadboard because\n  it can scratch the bottom and damage the connection. One exception: strip\n  about 15\u00a0mm from the end of a wire that will be clamped in one of the binding\n  posts. Make sure copper is showing on both sides of the post when it is\n  clamped down.\n\n\nWhen inserting a wire or component, use your needle nosed pliers\n  rather than your fingers to hold it. Grip the wire or lead about 10\u00a0mm from\n  the end and press straight down.\n\n\nIf the end of a wire becomes kinked, cut it off or use your pliers\n  to straighten it.",

Good engineering practice\nis to break down a complex system into a number of simple subsystems, each of\nwhich performs a single, well-defined function.

            "text": "The basic idea of wiring on a solderless breadboard is simple: just stick the\nends of the component leads or wires into the holes. But like any seemingly\nsimple process, there are a few subtleties that can make the difference between\nsuccess and failure.  First a note of caution. The material that the clips inside the breadboard are\nmade of (so called \"nickel silver\") is a compromise between good conductivity,\ncorrosion resistance, and springiness. In particular the elastic limit is\nconsiderably less than of a good steel spring and if spread too far, can be\npermanently distorted. To avoid deforming the connector clips:   Use only the wire that is supplied to you (24 gauge, solid\n  telephone cable).  Use only components with small diameter leads (1/4 watt resistors,\n  capacitors, ICs, etc.).  Do not insert power resistor leads into the breadboard.  When using power  transistors in the breadboard, use your pliers to\n  twist each lead 90 degrees so that they are gripped by the broad face rather\n  than the narrow edge.  Never insert more than one wire in a hole.   With the health of our breadboard assured, there are a few more things we can\ndo to make sure that our connections are good ones.   Strip about 7\u00a0mm of insulation from each end of a piece of wire.\n  Less than that raises the risk that insulation will be forced between the\n  fingers of the clip. More leaves bare wire exposed that can short to adjacent\n  components. Don't try to jam the wires far down into the breadboard because\n  it can scratch the bottom and damage the connection. One exception: strip\n  about 15\u00a0mm from the end of a wire that will be clamped in one of the binding\n  posts. Make sure copper is showing on both sides of the post when it is\n  clamped down.  When inserting a wire or component, use your needle nosed pliers\n  rather than your fingers to hold it. Grip the wire or lead about 10\u00a0mm from\n  the end and press straight down.  If the end of a wire becomes kinked, cut it off or use your pliers\n  to straighten it.",

The two most common ways are:  \n\n\n\n\nby cooking you (the hard way)\n\n\nby disrupting your nervous system (the easy way)\n\n\n\n\nThe good news is that in ELEC 240 laboratory, you will not be exposed to\ndangerous voltage levels \nunless\n you mishandle the equipment. Before we get\nclose enough to the equipment to mishandle it, let's take a closer look at just\nhow you can get hurt if you do.\n\n\nWhat strength voltages and currents are harmful?\n\n\nElectricity is potentially the most dangerous commodity in general use by the\npublic today. In spite of this, less than 1 percent of the 100,000 accidental\ndeaths which occur annually in the United States are directly attributable to\nelectrocution. Considering the ever-increasing use of electricity in the home\nand industry, we should be alert to protect and better this excellent safety\nrecord. An understanding of the effects of electric shock, high-frequency\nheating, and other electrically produced physiological phenomena on the human\nbody should be part of basic knowledge. We present a brief survey of these\ntopics in the hope that you will become aware of the very real dangers inherent\nin the application of electrical phenomena. We shall consider these dangers in\neach frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum - from the power\nfrequencies to cosmic rays.\n\n\nPower Frequencies\n\n\nElectric Shock.\n The ratio of fatalities to injuries for electric shock\naccidents is very high in comparison to the corresponding figure for all other\naccidents. \nDeath due to electric shock is fast and permanent.\n\n\nShock Sensitivity.\n Because of a person's highly developed nervous system,\nthey are sensitive to very small currents. For example, the tongue will give a\nsensation of taste at currents as low as 45 microamperes. The threshold of\nfeeling on the hand is found to be on the order of 5\u00a0mA DC and 1\u00a0mA at 60\u00a0Hz.\nThe shocks due to currents at this threshold are usually considered annoying\nrather than dangerous.  However, they are startling when not anticipated, and\nmay cause involuntary movement that sometimes results in serious injury. As the\nvalue of current increases above the threshold, one becomes aware of sensations\nof heat and contraction of the muscles. Sensations of pain develop and\nvoluntary control of the muscles in the path of the current becomes\nincreasingly difficult. Finally a value of current is reached where the victim\n\"freezes\" to the circuit. The value of current at which a victim can just\nrelease the electrode is referred to as \"let-go\" current. The average let-go\ncurrent for healthy people is about 16\u00a0mA rms (60\u00a0Hz). It is important to note\nthat let-go currents of as low as 5\u00a0mA have been measured. Experience has shown\nthat an individual can withstand, with no ill aftereffect except for possible\nsore muscles, repeated exposure to their let-go current for at least the time\nrequired for them to release the conductor.\n\n\nEffect of Frequency and Waveform.\n Gradually increasing direct current\nproduces sensations of internal heating. Sudden changes of current, however,\nproduce powerful muscular contractions, and interruption of the current causes\nvery severe shocks. Experiments at 10\u00a0kHz indicate that the let-go current is\napproximately 3 times the 60\u00a0Hz value. For non-sinusoidal waveforms, the peak\nvalue seems to be the critical factor in muscular stimulation.\n\n\nNature of Bodily Damage.\n As far as gross electrical effects are concerned,\nthe body can be represented by the equivalent circuit shown in the figure\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outer skin (epidermis) is roughly 0.1\u00a0mm thick and has a resistance of the\norder of \n\\(10^5 \\Omega cm^2\\)\n when dry. The inner skin (dermis)\nand the internal organs are of relatively low resistance because of their high\nsalinity. It is generally believed that the effects of electric shock are due\nto the current flowing through the body. Electrical burns are a result of\nheating the skin. The immediate formation of blisters at the point of contact\ncauses the skin to lose its protective resistance and more serious damage may\nthus occur. Burns of this nature penetrate quite deeply and, while they seldom\nbecome infected, heal very slowly. Electrical current is most dangerous when\nvital organs are in its path through the body. Current may cause stoppage of\nbreathing due to excessive contraction of the chest muscles.  Temporary\nparalysis of respiration may also occur if the current produces a block in the\nnervous system that prevents signals from reaching the lungs. In either case,\nit is imperative that an approved form of artificial respiration be applied\nimmediately and continued without interruption until competent medical\nexamination has been made.\n\n\nVentricular Fibrillation.\n Passage of electrical current through the heart\nis considered particularly dangerous. The heart exerts its pumping action as a\nresult of complex rhythmic motion controlled by periodic electrical impulses to\nthe muscle tissue. The regularity of this motion assures proper blood\ncirculation. Electric current passing through the heart completely upsets this\nrhythmic motion and results in random muscular contractions. The heart no\nlonger effectively pumps, but quivers like so much \"Jell-O\". This condition is\nknown as ventricular fibrillation and is nearly always fatal. Energy of the\nimpulse of current is responsible for this hazard and an estimate of the danger\nthreshold for fibrillation is 13.5\u00a0watt-seconds.\n\n\nRadio Frequencies\n\n\nAt frequencies above the power range, the primary bodily damage results from\ndielectric heating. Heating also occurs from both conduction current and\nradiation. The temperature of the human body is maintained remarkably constant\nby very complex temperature regulating mechanisms.  These mechanisms,\ncoordinated by the brain, control temperature by regulating the production and\nloss of heat. Circulation of bodily fluids contributes to the distribution of\nthe heat. The change in diameter of the blood vessels, for example, regulates\nthe volume and velocity of flow. However, not all areas are equally well\nregulated, and it is possible for local heating to occur. Such local heating is\napt to be dangerous, particularly if vital organs are involved. A differential\nof \n\\(5^\\circ\\text{C}\\)\n maintained for a sufficient time may be injurious or even\nlethal. Testes, for example, undergo degenerate changes with temperature rises\nas low as \n\\(1^\\circ\\text{C}\\)\n. The amount of bodily temperature rise depends on\nthe specific area exposed and its efficiency of heat elimination. Other factors\ncontributing to temperature rise are intensity and the duration of exposure. At\nfrequencies below the microwave region \n\\(f \n 1000\\text{MHz})\\)\n, about 40 percent\nof the incident energy is absorbed. These frequencies cause deep (internal)\nheating and are very dangerous: such heating is not well indicated by sensory\nelements of the skin.  A tolerance figure of \n\\(0.001\\text{ }{watt}\\text{\n}{cm}^2\\)\n for long-term exposures has been considered adequate. Surface burns\nresulting from R.F.  currents are similar to those encountered at lower\nfrequencies.\n\n\nMicrowave Frequencies\n\n\nThe effects of the lower microwave frequencies are similar to those of radio\nfrequencies and a comparable tolerance figure for exposure should not be\nexceeded. As the frequency increases \n\\(f \n 3000\\text{MHz}\\)\n, the incident energy\nis absorbed by the skin with an efficiency of 40 to 50 percent. The effects of\nsuch radiation are much the same as is encountered with infrared and sunlight.\nThe possibility of the formation of eye cataracts must be considered at\nmicrowave frequencies. These cataracts result in impairment of vision or even\nblindness as a result of the formation of a white cloud in the normally\ntransparent cornea of the eye. Cataracts are thought to occur in a manner\nanalogous to the formation of the \"white\" of an egg upon heating. Experiments\nwith rabbits have indicated that cataracts have formed in 3 to 9 days following\na single 15 minute exposure to a 100 watt source of 12\u00a0cm waves at a distance\nof 5\u00a0cm.  While the exposure indicated here is probably extreme, care should be\ntaken when working with high-powered radar sets.\n\n\nInfrared, Visible Light and Ultraviolet Frequencies\n\n\nThe immediate effects of this band of frequencies are popularly known as\nsunburn. The eye, however, is particularly susceptible to excess exposure at\nthese frequencies. Such exposure can easily occur when observing an electric\narc without protection. This may result in hemorrhages of the choriod (the\nouter lining of the retina) and actual destruction of portions of the retina\nitself. In addition, actual immediate pain may be encountered because of\nviolent contractions induced in the iris. Photophthalmia (temporary snow\nblindness) is due to ultraviolet radiation following undue exposure to\nsunlight, an electric arc, or a sun lamp.\n\n\nX-Rays and Nuclear Radiation\n\n\nThe effects of this portion of the electromagnetic spectrum of the human body\nare still being studied. It has been found that the amount of energy absorbed\nby the tissue during exposure is the most important consideration. Damage to\nthe reproductive organs has been found to be the most sensitive indication of\nexcessive exposure. Controlled experiments with mice exposed to fast neutron\nradiation from an atomic reactor indicate the type of damage sustained by\nliving animals. During the first 9 months of continuous exposure, no visible\ndifferences were noted. The mice then began to lose weight and gradually lose\nhair. Eye cataracts developed after a year and death followed. Limited exposure\nto nuclear radiation resulted in a shortened life span. We have yet to\ncompletely determine the consequences of the atomic bombs of World War II in\nterms of its biological effects. For this reason, plus the fact that the latent\nperiod between exposure and detection of damage may run into months and years,\nit behooves us to take all precautions against X-Ray and nuclear radiation.",

These cataracts result in impairment of vision or even\nblindness as a result of the formation of a white cloud in the normally\ntransparent cornea of the eye. Cataracts are thought to occur in a manner\nanalogous to the formation of the \"white\" of an egg upon heating. Experiments\nwith rabbits have indicated that cataracts have formed in 3 to 9 days following\na single 15 minute exposure to a 100 watt source of 12\u00a0cm waves at a distance\nof 5\u00a0cm.  While the exposure indicated here is probably extreme, care should be\ntaken when working with high-powered radar sets.",

Let's\nfind out how the current and voltage of our light bulb are related.\n\n\nFor this measurement, we will need to vary the voltage applied to the bulb, so\nwe will need a variable voltage source.

To be useful its input or output (or\nboth) should be connected to some other circuit. Unfortunately the\ninteraction between the circuit and a non-ideal source or load causes\nit to behave differently than it would in an idealized situation. With\ncareful design, this interaction can be minimized or accounted for. If\nignored it can reduce the performance of the system, or keep it from\nworking altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C: The Potentiometer\n\n\nA potentiometer (pot for short) is a fixed value resistor with a third, movable\ncontact or \nslider\n which may be positioned anywhere along the resistive\nelement. If we represent the position of the slider by \n\\(\\alpha\\)\n, where \n\\(\\alpha\\)\n\nvaries between 0 (fully counterclockwise) and 1 (fully clockwise), then the\nresistance between the lower end of the resistor and the slider will be \n\\(\\alpha\nR\\)\n and between the slider and the upper end will be \n\\((1-\\alpha)R\\)\n, where \n\\(R\\)\n is\nthe total resistance of the potentiometer.\n\n\nIf we connect the two fixed contacts to a voltage source and measure the output\nbetween the movable contact and one fixed contact, we get a variable voltage\ndivider:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the output is:\n\n\n\\[\nv_{out} = \\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}v_{in}\n        = \\frac{\\alpha R}{(1 - \\alpha)R + \\alpha R}v_{in}\n        = \\alpha v_{in}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSelect a 10k\u2126 potentiometer. It will have three short wires sticking out in\n   a triangular pattern. The center terminal is the slider contact and the two\n   outer terminals are the fixed contacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFiguring out the value of a pot can be tricky. Some pots are labeled\ndirectly with the value (e.g. \"100\" or \"10K\"). Others are labeled using\nthe same code as for fixed resistors, except that numbers, rather than\ncolors, are used. For example, a 10k\u2126 resistor would have the bands\nbrown-black-orange. The values of these colors are 1, 0, and 3, so a\n10k\u2126 pot would have the label \"103\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWire the following circuit:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the function generator to produce a \n\\(2 V_{pp}\\)\n 100-Hz sine wave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a screwdriver from your toolkit, turn the crosshairs on the potentiometer to the midpoint. \nNote down \n\\(v_{out}\\)\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pot has a scale divided into 10 equal divisions, presumably representing\n   10 equal divisions of resistance. Set the pot to each of these 10 divisions\n   and measure \n\\(v_{out}\\)\n. \nIs this presumption correct?\n If the pot you selected does not have division markings, approximate 4-6 equal divisions and do the measurements.",

If we represent the position of the slider by  \\(\\alpha\\) , where  \\(\\alpha\\) \nvaries between 0 (fully counterclockwise) and 1 (fully clockwise), then the\nresistance between the lower end of the resistor and the slider will be  \\(\\alpha\nR\\)  and between the slider and the upper end will be  \\((1-\\alpha)R\\) , where  \\(R\\)  is\nthe total resistance of the potentiometer.  If we connect the two fixed contacts to a voltage source and measure the output\nbetween the movable contact and one fixed contact, we get a variable voltage\ndivider:     Then the output is:  \\[\nv_{out} = \\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}v_{in}\n        = \\frac{\\alpha R}{(1 - \\alpha)R + \\alpha R}v_{in}\n        = \\alpha v_{in}\n\\]   Select a 10k\u2126 potentiometer.

Note  Figuring out the value of a pot can be tricky. Some pots are labeled\ndirectly with the value (e.g. \"100\" or \"10K\").

The values of these colors are 1, 0, and 3, so a\n10k\u2126 pot would have the label \"103\".     Wire the following circuit:       Set the function generator to produce a  \\(2 V_{pp}\\)  100-Hz sine wave.    Using a screwdriver from your toolkit, turn the crosshairs on the potentiometer to the midpoint.  Note down  \\(v_{out}\\) .

Is this presumption correct?  If the pot you selected does not have division markings, approximate 4-6 equal divisions and do the measurements.",

We've used only one or two of the interface components at a\ntime and we've built circuits consisting of 2 or 3 components which we've\ndisassembled at the end of lab. With this Lab we will begin constructing more\ncomplicated circuits having more external connections. Since some of these will\nperform functions we will need in other Labs, we will want to leave them in\nplace on the breadboard for future use. To keep this from degenerating into\nchaos, we need a plan for organizing the layout and wiring on the breadboard\nand interface board.\n\n\nThere are several aspects to this organization ranging from small details to\nthe big picture.\n\n\nColor Coding\n\n\nThere are different colored wires available to use. You could just pick pieces\nof wire at random, or you could try to use the different colors to designate\ndifferent signals. There aren't enough colors for each signal to have its own,\nbut you can use different colors to denote different classes of signals.\n\n\nOne set of signals you should color code are power and ground. In particular,\nyou should have a different color for \n\\(+15\u00a0V\\)\n, \n\\(-15\u00a0V\\)\n, and ground and you should\nnot use any of these colors for other signals. It would be nice to use\n\"standard\" colors for these, but unfortunately there are several competing\nstandards. One color that nearly everyone agrees on is that red should be the\npositive power supply voltage. Most automotive and electronic wiring uses black\nto denote ground. Electronic wiring which uses black for ground often uses blue\nfor the negative supply. However, our power supply and breadboard use green to\ndenote ground (the convention used in house wiring) and use black to denote the\nnegative supply.\n\n\nSo we have two possible \"standard\" color codes for power: \n\n\n\n\nred\u00a0=\u00a0+, green\u00a0=\u00a0gnd, black\u00a0=\u00a0-\n\n\nred\u00a0=\u00a0+, black\u00a0=\u00a0gnd, blue\u00a0 =\u00a0-\n\n\n\n\nYou could use either of these, or make up your own. The pictures in this lab\nuse set 1.\n\n\nAnother useful thing to color code would be the wires or \"probes\" from the\ninterface board connector. That way you can tell which wire is \nCH1\n of the\nscope or which is the function generator output without having to trace from\none end of the wire to the other.\n\n\nPower Bussing\n\n\nEach of the power bus strips has three rows of contacts, so we can distribute\nground, \n\\(+15\u00a0V\\)\n, and \n\\(-15\u00a0V\\)\n throughout the entire breadboard area. Remembering\nto connect the two halves of each row together, we get the following layout for\npower:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterface Board Connector Assignments\n\n\nSome of the connectors on the Interface Board are dedicated to a single\nfunction (e.g. the telephone handset or the sound card). Others (e.g.  the BNC\nand phone jacks) are more flexible and may be connected to a variety of signal\nsources or destinations. It will be helpful to establish standard assignments\nfor these connectors as well.\n\n\nIn the instructions and photographs, we will be using the following assignment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnector\n\n\nSocket Pin\n\n\nSignal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ1-1\n\n\n1\n\n\nOscilloscope channel 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ1-2\n\n\n2\n\n\nOscilloscope channel 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ1-3\n\n\n3\n\n\nFunction generator output\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ1-6\n\n\n8\n\n\nMicrophone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall Layout\n\n\nWhen building a fairly complex circuit like you will in Lab 10, involving at\nleast 4 op-amps and a dozen or so resistors and capacitors, good engineering\npractice is to break down a complex system into a number of simple subsystems,\neach of which performs a single, well-defined function.\n\n\nIn the unlikely event that your circuit does not work perfectly the first time\nyou turn it on, it will make it easier for you (and your labbie) to debug it if\neach of these subcircuits is laid out (neatly, of course) on its own little\npatch of breadboard and is connected to the other subcircuits in such a way\nthat it may be easilly disconnected from them for testing in isolation.\n\n\nOne of the circuits we will build this week, the microphone amplifier and\nmixer, will be used in most of our subsequent labs.

Unfortunately, it's also considerably more\ndelicate, so connecting it incorrectly can destroy it (often without so\nmuch as a puff of smoke to let you know that it has become an\ninoperational amplifier.

This is\n   called slew-rate limiting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the DC offset on the FGEN is zero. \nDoes the output also show\n   zero DC offset?\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe have just seen a number of the shortcomings of a real (as opposed to\nan ideal) operational amplifier: clipping, which limits the maximum\namplitude of the output; slew-rate limiting, which limits the maximum\nslope of the output; and offset, which gives a non-zero output for zero\ninput.\n\n\nWhen we reduce the overall gain with feedback, some of these (e.g.\noffset) are reduced significantly, and we get an output which is a\nfaithful reproduction of the input. However, other limits (such as\nmaximum output level) must be respected for this fidelity to remain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummarize why, if we want to amplify our signal with an op-amp, operating\n   it in open loop is not the ideal solution.",

Set the function generator to produce a  \\(2 V_{pp}\\) , 20 Hz sine wave.    Connect the function generator output to  \\(v_{in}\\)  of the circuit above.\n   Connect  CH1  of the scope to  \\(v_{in}\\)  and  CH2  to  \\(v_{out}\\) . Set the  CH2 \n    VOLTS/DIV  to 5. Make sure both channels of the scope are on DC.   Note  You should see a badly distorted (clipped) waveform at  \\(v_{out}\\) . If you\ndon't, try increasing the function generator output.     Adjust the distorted waveform (will look like a square wave) so that it is\n   symmetric about the x-axis.  Note the positive and negative peak values of\n    \\(v_{out}\\) .    Connect a 100\u2126 resistor from  \\(v_{out}\\)  to ground.  What happens to the\n   output signal?    Remove the 100\u2126 resistor from the op amp output.    Set the FGEN to square wave.  Now what is the shape of the  \\(v_{out}\\) \n   waveform?  Does the output change slope as fast as the input does? This is\n   called slew-rate limiting.    Make sure the DC offset on the FGEN is zero.  Does the output also show\n   zero DC offset?   Note  We have just seen a number of the shortcomings of a real (as opposed to\nan ideal) operational amplifier: clipping, which limits the maximum\namplitude of the output; slew-rate limiting, which limits the maximum\nslope of the output; and offset, which gives a non-zero output for zero\ninput.  When we reduce the overall gain with feedback, some of these (e.g.\noffset) are reduced significantly, and we get an output which is a\nfaithful reproduction of the input. However, other limits (such as\nmaximum output level) must be respected for this fidelity to remain.     Summarize why, if we want to amplify our signal with an op-amp, operating\n   it in open loop is not the ideal solution.",

To make up this discrepancy, we need to\namplify the signal levels produced by the input transducers.\n\n\nPart A: Photodiode Amplifier\n\n\nThe inverting op-amp circuit works by taking the current that flows into the\n\"virtual ground\" at the inverting input and forcing it to flow in the feedback\nresistor. Since the voltage across \n\\(R_F\\)\n is equal to \n\\(R_FI_F\\)\n, the output\nvoltage (on the other terminal of \n\\(R_F\\)\n is proportional to the current flowing\ninto the virtual ground. What if instead of this current originating from the\nvoltage across \n\\(R_1\\)\n, it instead came directly from a current source? Well, the\noutput voltage would still be proportional to it: \n\\(v_{out} = -R_FI_F =\n-R_FI_{in}\\)\n, i.e., we have an amplifier which accepts a current as an input and\nproduces a voltage as an output. This is called a \ntransresistance amplifier\n.\n(Since a resistance converts its current to a voltage (\n\\(v=Ri\\)\n), a\ntransresistance converts a current in one part of the circuit to a voltage in\nanother.)\n\n\nIn Lab 2 we measured the \nvoltage\n across the photodiode and found some fairly\ndistorted waveforms. It turns out that the \ncurrent\n produced by a photodiode\nis proportional to the intensity of the light falling on it, while the voltage\nis proportional to the \nlogarithm\n of the intensity, hence the distortion. If\nwe could produce an output signal proportional to the photodiode current, we\nwould have a much better transducer.\n\n\n\n\nWire the following circuit. (You can modify the previous circuit by removing\n   the 10 k\u2126 resistor and replacing it with the photodiode (connected to ground\n   rather than to the function generator)).\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you did in Lab 2, note the output voltage, \n\\(v_{out}\\)\n, and observe how it\n   changes as you cover and uncover the photodiode with your hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the function generator to produce an \n\\(8 V_{ pp }\\)\n, 100 Hz triangle wave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisconnect the BNC patch cord from the function generator output and connect\n   the BNC clip leads.

Slowly separate the LED from the photodiode, adjusting the\n   alignment to maintain the best signal (just like Lab 2).  What is the\n   maximum distance you can get with this configuration and still get a\n   recognizable square wave signal? \nHow does it compare with what you got in\n   Lab 2?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove the BNC clip leads, reduce the amplitude of the function generator,\n   and reconnect the BNC patch cord.

The\nmicrophone that is housed in a telephone handset is called a \ncarbon-button\n\n(or \ncarbon\n for short) microphone. The output of the carbon microphone is\nclose to our standard \n\\(1 V\\)\n level, but for the dynamic microphone to be useful,\nwe will need to amplify its output. If we don't mind the change of sign (which\nwe don't for this application), we have just the circuit we need.\n\n\nWe will use this circuit in several subsequent labs, so build it in a\nconvenient part of the breadboard (see discussion in \nOrganizing your\nBreadboard\n) and leave it assembled when lab is\nover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook back in your lab report to find the value you measured for the output\n   voltage of the dynamic microphone. \nCalculate the gain \n\\(G\\)\n required to\n   amplify this to a \n\\(1 V_{ pp }\\)\n signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the value of \n\\(R_1\\)\n that will give the circuit below a\ngain of \n\\(G\\)\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWire the above circuit by modifying your circuit from Part A, and\nconnect \n\\(v_in\\)\n to J1-6-left (Pin 8 on the Interface Board socket strip).\nPlug the dynamic microphone into J1-6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak into the microphone and observe \n\\(v_{out}\\)\n. Does it have the amplitude\n   you expected? If not, adjust \n\\(R_1\\)\n until \n\\(v_{out}\\)\n is approximately \n\\(1 V_{ pp\n   }\\)\n when speaking in a normal voice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C: Mixer\n\n\nWe want to be able to use both the dynamic microphone and the carbon\nmicrophone. We could build separate amplifiers for each and switch back and\nforth, but it would be more convenient to be able to use either one (or both)\nwith no changes to the circuit.\n\n\nSince Kirchhoff's Current Law must hold true at the negative input/virtual\nground, if more than one current source is connected to it, the output voltage\nmust be proportional to the sum of the currents.  Consider the following\ncircuit:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow in your report that the output is a weighted sum of its inputs\n, in\n   other words:\n\n\n\\[\nv_{out} = - \\left( \\frac{R_F}{R_1}v_1 + \\frac{R_F}{R_2}v_2 \\right)\n\\]\nWe can use this circuit as a \nmixer\n to amplify both the dynamic microphone\noutput and the carbon microphone output by the appropriate amount, and then\ncombine them into a single signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst construct the carbon microphone interface.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe carbon microphone is a resistive, or passive transducer.  This\nmeans that it doesn't convert acoustical energy to electrical energy\ndirectly, but instead the acoustical energy varies some electrical\nparameter (i.e., resistance). In order to interpret this change in\nresistance, the transducer needs to be powered by an external source\nwhich then produces a voltage output corresponding to the change in\nresistance. We do this by powering the carbon microphone with a voltage\nsource in series with a large resistor (i.e., creating a voltage\ndivider circuit).\n\n\n\n\nThe following circuit should do nicely. Wire this circuit to the right of\nyour dynamic microphone amplifier, and we will connect the two in a couple\nof steps. (The carbon microphone is pins 12 and 13 on the interface\nconnector. There is a ground on pin 14).\n\n\n \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlug the handset into J1-7. Speak into the handset microphone and verify\n   that the above circuit works. Speak in the same normal voice you used for\n   the dynamic microphone and \nmeasure the peak-to-peak amplitude of the\n   signal\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to get rid of the pesky DC offset in the carbon microphone output.\n   On the scope we can do this by switching to the AC position. Or instead, we\n   can put a capacitor in series with the input. Putting it all together gives\n   us the following circuit:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute the value of \n\\(R_2\\)\n required to give an output of \n\\(1V_{ pp }\\)\n.\n   Put together your two subcircuits and create the above circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak into each microphone and verify that \n\\(v_{out}\\)\n is about \n\\(1 V_{ pp }\\)\n in\n   each case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the op-amp can drive a 100\u2126 resistance to more than our standard\n   voltage level, and since the handset earpiece resistance is greater than\n   100\u2126, we should be able to drive it from the op-amp output. Connect one side\n   of the earpiece (Pin 11 on the interface board) to ground (Pin 14).  Connect\n   the other side (Pin 10) to \n\\(v_{out}\\)\n. Have your lab partner speak into the\n   dynamic microphone while you hold the handset to your ear and speak into its\n   microphone. Verify that both voices are audible simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\nDo not dissemble this circuit. We will use it in subsequent labs.",

Since Kirchhoff's Current Law must hold true at the negative input/virtual\nground, if more than one current source is connected to it, the output voltage\nmust be proportional to the sum of the currents.  Consider the following\ncircuit:       Show in your report that the output is a weighted sum of its inputs , in\n   other words:  \\[\nv_{out} = - \\left( \\frac{R_F}{R_1}v_1 + \\frac{R_F}{R_2}v_2 \\right)\n\\] We can use this circuit as a  mixer  to amplify both the dynamic microphone\noutput and the carbon microphone output by the appropriate amount, and then\ncombine them into a single signal.    First construct the carbon microphone interface.   Note  The carbon microphone is a resistive, or passive transducer.  This\nmeans that it doesn't convert acoustical energy to electrical energy\ndirectly, but instead the acoustical energy varies some electrical\nparameter (i.e., resistance). In order to interpret this change in\nresistance, the transducer needs to be powered by an external source\nwhich then produces a voltage output corresponding to the change in\nresistance. We do this by powering the carbon microphone with a voltage\nsource in series with a large resistor (i.e., creating a voltage\ndivider circuit).   The following circuit should do nicely. Wire this circuit to the right of\nyour dynamic microphone amplifier, and we will connect the two in a couple\nof steps. (The carbon microphone is pins 12 and 13 on the interface\nconnector. There is a ground on pin 14).            Plug the handset into J1-7. Speak into the handset microphone and verify\n   that the above circuit works. Speak in the same normal voice you used for\n   the dynamic microphone and  measure the peak-to-peak amplitude of the\n   signal .    We need to get rid of the pesky DC offset in the carbon microphone output.\n   On the scope we can do this by switching to the AC position. Or instead, we\n   can put a capacitor in series with the input. Putting it all together gives\n   us the following circuit:       Compute the value of  \\(R_2\\)  required to give an output of  \\(1V_{ pp }\\) .\n   Put together your two subcircuits and create the above circuit.    Speak into each microphone and verify that  \\(v_{out}\\)  is about  \\(1 V_{ pp }\\)  in\n   each case.    Since the op-amp can drive a 100\u2126 resistance to more than our standard\n   voltage level, and since the handset earpiece resistance is greater than\n   100\u2126, we should be able to drive it from the op-amp output. Connect one side\n   of the earpiece (Pin 11 on the interface board) to ground (Pin 14).  Connect\n   the other side (Pin 10) to  \\(v_{out}\\) . Have your lab partner speak into the\n   dynamic microphone while you hold the handset to your ear and speak into its\n   microphone. Verify that both voices are audible simultaneously.   Caution  Do not dissemble this circuit. We will use it in subsequent labs.",

The frequency\ncontent can be viewed by plotting the signal's frequency spectrum. The spectrum\nof a sine wave should be pretty boring. By definition it consists of a single\ncomponent at the fundamental frequency whose amplitude is equal to the\namplitude of the waveform. Nevertheless, it is useful being able to see the\namplitude and frequency in a single picture, as well as being able to assess\nhow \"pure\" (i.e. how truly sinusoidal) the purported sine wave actually is.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Start menu, open the program NI Labview 2016. Click on Start\n    Labview.\n\n\n\n\nIn the window that opens up, select Create Project, and then select Blank\n    VI.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nVI stands for Virtual Instrument. Labview is a versatile software tool\nthat allows you to custom-build instrumentation that can acquire,\ngenerate, process, and analyze signals according to your design needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo windows will pop up, one titled Front Panel and the other titled Block\n    Diagram. Let's first create the Front Panel of your virtual instrument,\n    so bring that window to the foreground, which should also bring up a\n    Controls palette window. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the Controls palette does not pop up automatically, you can open it\nby selecting View \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Controls Palette, or by right-clicking\non a blank area of the front panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Controls palette contains objects that can be added to form the user\n    interface. There are two types of objects: controls and indicators. A\n    control is an input from the user that gets passed to the virtual\n    instrument, while an indicator is an output display (numeric or plot), from\n    the virtual instrument. From the Controls palette, select Modern\n    \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Numeric \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Dial. Left-click on the Front Panel to\n    place the dial onto the panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, place a Numeric Control from the Numeric subpalette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen from the Control palette, select Modern \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Graph\n    \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Waveform Graph. Your Front Panel should like the figure\n    below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWaveform Graph accepts and plots an array of data values all at once.\nThis is different from Waveform Chart, which scrolls data continuously\nand refreshes the display as new data is added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow click on the Block Diagram window to bring it up. You should see three\n    nodes already placed on it, which correspond to the objects placed on the\n    Front Panel.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNotice the small black arrows which indicate the direction of data flow\n(into or out of the node). Nodes are color-coded, which indicates the\ndata type. In this case, the nodes are orange, the color code for\nfloating point. The DBL marking indicates double precision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now see a Functions palette in place of the Control palette.\n    Under the Programming subpalette, select Waveform \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Analog Wfm\n    \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Generation \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Sine Wfm and place it on the Block\n    Diagram.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWaveform is a unique cluster data type of Labview that contains three\nelements of information. The first element is an array of signal\namplitude values, the second is the start time of the signal, and the\nthird is the time interval between data points. Bundling many different\nkinds of information such as the waveform data type is called a cluster\ndata type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the same Generation menu, place a Uniform White Noise block on your\n    Block Diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd one more block to your diagram, the Add block, located at Programming\n    \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Numeric \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Add. Your Block Diagram should look\n    something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you hover the mouse pointer over any block, you will see that all the\n    input and output pins appear. When you hover over any of these pins, the\n    mouse pointer symbol changes to look like a spool of wire. Click on the\n    Dial output pin (orange) and wire it to the Frequency input pin of the Sine\n    Waveform block.\n\n\n\n\nWiring Tips\n\n\n\n\nWhile wiring, you can left-click to lock the wire in place and continue\n  to route the wire the way you want to.\n\n\nMove wires around by clicking and dragging.\n\n\nEscape wiring mode by right-clicking, or just delete the undesired wire\n  with Delete. \n\n\nRemove all broken wires from the Block Diagram by pressing Ctrl-B.\n\n\nMake your wiring look pretty by right-clicking a wire and selecting\n  Clean Up Wire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWire the Numeric Control to Amplitude to the Amplitude pin of Sine\n    Waveform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the \nDial\n label to \nFrequency (Hz)\n, and\n    \nNumeric\n label to \nAmplitude\n by double-clicking the labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight-click on the amplitude input of the Uniform White Noise Waveform\n    block and select Create \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Constant. The default constant will\n    be 1 which is what we will use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can change a constant by double-clicking the value. However, while\na VI is running, a constant cannot be changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinish wiring your block diagram so that it looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe maroon wire indicates the information passed is of the waveform\ndata type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck if the Run button at the top left of the screen is a white arrow. If\n    it looks like a broken gray arrow, there is some error in your block\n    diagram (i.e., such as broken wires).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Front Panel, set your frequency to 2 Hz, and amplitude to 5. Press\n    the white arrow Run. You should see a waveform like displayed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can numerically enter the frequency if you want by right-clicking\nthe dial, and selecting Visible Items \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Digital Display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B: Creating a Spectrum Analyzer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we will perform a frequency spectrum analysis on this noisy sine wave\n    using a built-in Labview Power Spectrum function that uses the Fast Fourier\n    Transform (FFT) algorithm. Go to the Block Diagram window and add the FFT\n    Power Spectrum block located at Waveform \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Analog Wfm\n    \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Measurements \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n FFT Power Spectrum and PSD. Place\n    this block in your Block Diagram, and add a new Waveform Graph to your\n    Front Panel. Label your new graph as Power Spectrum, and change the x-axis\n    label to Frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe pink wire indicates a generic cluster data type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make our spectrum analyzer capable of handling changing\n    signals, we will add a while loop around the block diagram so it runs\n    continuously until the VI is stopped. In the Functions palette, go to\n    Programming \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Structures \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n While Loop, click once\n    at the top left of your block diagram, and draw a loop around your block\n    diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Front Panel window, place a Stop button control under Modern\n    \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Boolean \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Stop Button. A Stop node should be\n    automatically placed on your block diagram. Move it near the red dot (Loop\n    Condition) and connect the Stop node to it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Front Panel, change the frequency range to 0-500Hz by\n    double-clicking on the dial's highest marking. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the dial to 200 Hz and Run. \nTake a screenshot of the spectral plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn the dial to various frequencies and \ncomment on how the spectral plot\n    changes.\n You can stop the VI by pressing the Stop button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let's find out what the other built-in features of the Power Spectrum\n    block are. Go to your Block Diagram and right-click on the window pin.\n    Select Create \n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n Control. This will drop a control object\n    labeled \nwindow\n on your Front Panel. Do the same for the \ndB On\n and\n    \naveraging parameters\n pins. Play around with the different controls you\n    created and \ncomment on how the different settings affect your spectral\n    plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a screenshot of the Block Diagram and Front Panel of the spectrum\n    analyzer you have just built.",

Let's first create the Front Panel of your virtual instrument,\n    so bring that window to the foreground, which should also bring up a\n    Controls palette window.    Note  If the Controls palette does not pop up automatically, you can open it\nby selecting View  \\(\\rightarrow\\)  Controls Palette, or by right-clicking\non a blank area of the front panel.     The Controls palette contains objects that can be added to form the user\n    interface. There are two types of objects: controls and indicators. A\n    control is an input from the user that gets passed to the virtual\n    instrument, while an indicator is an output display (numeric or plot), from\n    the virtual instrument. From the Controls palette, select Modern\n     \\(\\rightarrow\\)  Numeric  \\(\\rightarrow\\)  Dial. Left-click on the Front Panel to\n    place the dial onto the panel.    Next, place a Numeric Control from the Numeric subpalette.    Then from the Control palette, select Modern  \\(\\rightarrow\\)  Graph\n     \\(\\rightarrow\\)  Waveform Graph. Your Front Panel should like the figure\n    below:      Note  Waveform Graph accepts and plots an array of data values all at once.\nThis is different from Waveform Chart, which scrolls data continuously\nand refreshes the display as new data is added.     Now click on the Block Diagram window to bring it up. You should see three\n    nodes already placed on it, which correspond to the objects placed on the\n    Front Panel.   Note  Notice the small black arrows which indicate the direction of data flow\n(into or out of the node). Nodes are color-coded, which indicates the\ndata type. In this case, the nodes are orange, the color code for\nfloating point. The DBL marking indicates double precision.     You should now see a Functions palette in place of the Control palette.\n    Under the Programming subpalette, select Waveform  \\(\\rightarrow\\)  Analog Wfm\n     \\(\\rightarrow\\)  Generation  \\(\\rightarrow\\)  Sine Wfm and place it on the Block\n    Diagram.   Note  Waveform is a unique cluster data type of Labview that contains three\nelements of information. The first element is an array of signal\namplitude values, the second is the start time of the signal, and the\nthird is the time interval between data points. Bundling many different\nkinds of information such as the waveform data type is called a cluster\ndata type.     From the same Generation menu, place a Uniform White Noise block on your\n    Block Diagram.    Add one more block to your diagram, the Add block, located at Programming\n     \\(\\rightarrow\\)  Numeric  \\(\\rightarrow\\)  Add. Your Block Diagram should look\n    something like this:       When you hover the mouse pointer over any block, you will see that all the\n    input and output pins appear. When you hover over any of these pins, the\n    mouse pointer symbol changes to look like a spool of wire. Click on the\n    Dial output pin (orange) and wire it to the Frequency input pin of the Sine\n    Waveform block.   Wiring Tips   While wiring, you can left-click to lock the wire in place and continue\n  to route the wire the way you want to.  Move wires around by clicking and dragging.  Escape wiring mode by right-clicking, or just delete the undesired wire\n  with Delete.   Remove all broken wires from the Block Diagram by pressing Ctrl-B.  Make your wiring look pretty by right-clicking a wire and selecting\n  Clean Up Wire.      Wire the Numeric Control to Amplitude to the Amplitude pin of Sine\n    Waveform.    Change the  Dial  label to  Frequency (Hz) , and\n     Numeric  label to  Amplitude  by double-clicking the labels.    Right-click on the amplitude input of the Uniform White Noise Waveform\n    block and select Create  \\(\\rightarrow\\)  Constant. The default constant will\n    be 1 which is what we will use.      Note  You can change a constant by double-clicking the value. However, while\na VI is running, a constant cannot be changed.     Finish wiring your block diagram so that it looks like this:      Note  The maroon wire indicates the information passed is of the waveform\ndata type.     Check if the Run button at the top left of the screen is a white arrow. If\n    it looks like a broken gray arrow, there is some error in your block\n    diagram (i.e., such as broken wires).    In the Front Panel, set your frequency to 2 Hz, and amplitude to 5. Press\n    the white arrow Run. You should see a waveform like displayed below.      Note  You can numerically enter the frequency if you want by right-clicking\nthe dial, and selecting Visible Items  \\(\\rightarrow\\)  Digital Display.",

Turn dB option on for your\n    spectral plot for better viewing.

Select Log. Adjust the\n    amplitude if necessary to obtain a good display. \nDo you notice the\n    hyperbolic shape in which the harmonics fall off?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow get a log-log plot with magnitude in dB by changing the Y-scale to Log\n    and setting a multiplier of 20 (under Scale Factors). \nNote that the \n\\(1/f\\)\n\n    fall off is now a \"linear\" 20 dB/decade slope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch the function generator to a triangle wave. \nIs the slope now 40\n    dB/decade?\n Set the spectrum analyzer back to linear display (both \n    magnitude and frequency).

It may be difficult to get an accurate estimate if\n   the fundamental is low in frequency (e.g. a male voice). One way to improve\n   accuracy is to find the frequency of one of the higher harmonics and divide\n   by its order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile trying to keep the same pitch, produce different sustained vowel\n   sounds.

Connect CH1 of the scope and A/D input 4 to  \\(v_{out}\\) of the mixer circuit.    Set the spectrum analyzer to dB magnitude scale and linear frequency scale.    Produce a sustained vowel (a, e, i, o, u) sound. Note the form of the\n   spectrum. It should consist of a series of peaks, like the signals from the\n   function generator, but unlike the function generator signals where the\n   harmonics fall off monotonically, the amplitudes of the harmonics in a\n   speech signal rise and fall with increasing frequency.    To make it easier to study the spectrum, you can \"freeze\" the display by\n   pressing the STOP button (continue producing the sound until the freezing is\n   complete). If you like, you can get a printout of the display by selecting\n   \"Print Window\" from the File menu.    Estimate the fundamental frequency (pitch) of the waveform. Notice that\n   unlike the function generator signals, the fundamental is not necessarily\n   the strongest component. It may be difficult to get an accurate estimate if\n   the fundamental is low in frequency (e.g. a male voice). One way to improve\n   accuracy is to find the frequency of one of the higher harmonics and divide\n   by its order.    While trying to keep the same pitch, produce different sustained vowel\n   sounds. Note how the \"envelope\" of the spectrum (the line connecting the\n   tips of the peaks) changes while the positions of the lines remains the\n   same.    Now, produce the same sustained vowel sound (your choice) while varying the\n   pitch. Notice how the overall shape of the spectrum remains the same as the\n   lines move up and down.    Play some music from a single musical instrument from your phone, into the\n   microphone. Note the nature of the spectrum.    A soft whistle should be very close to a pure tone. Whistle a tone of about\n    1 kHz into the microphone and see if this is the case.    Plug in the telephone handset. Verify that the carbon microphone input to\n    the mixer still works by speaking into the handset microphone.    Whistle the same note into the handset microphone and observe the spectrum\n    display. Does it have the same harmonic content as with the dynamic\n    microphone? Since the acoustic signal was the same, the difference must be\n    caused by distortion in the microphone. Which microphone has the least\n    distortion?    Blow into the microphone and note the shape of the spectrum. This is\n    a broadband , random signal.    Produce an 'sh' sound. Note the shape of the spectrum. This is called\n    anunvoiced fricative.    Now try a 'zh' sound (a voiced fricative ). How does its spectrum compare\n    with the one in the previous step?    Based on your observations of different speech sounds,  can you determine\n    an approximate bandwidth for speech? i.e. is there a frequency below\n    which \"most\" of the energy of the speech signals is concentrated?",

By keeping our input signal below \n\\(5V\\)\n\nwe keep it within the range of the A/D converter and avoid \"clipping\" the\nsignal. However, when we add two signals together or send then through systems\nhaving a gain greater than one, we may create an output signal with values too\nlarge for the D/A converter to convert. If this happens you will hear\ndistortion in the output signal.  To avoid this, you can use the \nsoundsc()\n\ncommand instead of \nsound()\n. This command automatically scales the signal\nvalue so that it fits within the range of the D/A converter.  \n\n\nAnother interesting thing we can do is \nmultiply\n the two signals together.\nDigitally, this is just as easy to do as adding them, but this is very\ndifficult to do in an analog circuit. \n\n\nout3 = sig1 .* sig2;\n\n\n\n\nNote the special MATLAB construct \n.*\n denoting point by point multiplication,\nas opposed to matrix multiplication.

Can you identify either of the two signals in either the aural or\nvisual domains? \n\n\nPart B: Simple Filtering\n\n\nAs you saw in ELEC241, filtering a digital signal involves forming a weighted sum\nof the past input and output samples:\n\n\n\\[\na_0y(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{M} a_ky(n-k) + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} b_kx(n-k)\n\\]\nMatlab has a function for performing this operation: \n\n\ny = filter(b, a, x); \n\n\n\n\nChoosing the values of the \n\\(a_k\\)\n's and \n\\(b_k\\)\n's is the art of \nfilter design,\n\nwhich we'll look at in the next part. For now, we'll just try a few simple\nvalues for \n\\(\\vec{a}\\)\n and \n\\(\\vec{b}\\)\n.

The\nsimplest FIR filter is the \nboxcar\n filter in which all the \n\\(b_k\\)\n are equal to 1.\nDefine a length 5 boxcar filter:\n\n\na=1; \nb=[1 1 1 1 1]; \n\n\n\n\nMatlab has a function to compute and display the frequency response of a\nfilter: \n\n\nfreqz(b, a) \n\n\n\n\nTake a screenshot.\n\n\nNote that the frequency axis is labeled in terms of the Nyquist frequency,\nwhich is half the sampling rate. So for our sampling rate, 1 corresponds to 5 kHz.\nAlthough it is a little distorted because of the logarithmic scaling, this is a\nclose relative of our old friend \n\\(sin(x)/x\\)\n. Also note that the jumps in phase\nare caused by a change in sign of the transfer function (the magnitude is\nalways positive).  Taking this into account, the phase is a \nlinear\n function\nof frequency.  \n\n\nWe can also look at the \nunit-sample response\n of the filter: \n\n\ndelta = \\[1 zeros(1,100)\\];\ny = filter(b, a, delta); \nplot(y, '.') \n\n\n\n\nAs you would expect, the unit-sample response is a rectangular pulse, which\nsupposedly looks like the side view of a boxcar. Now let's try applying this\nfilter to our signal:\n\n\nout1 = filter(b, a, sig1); \n\n\n\n\nListen to \nout1\n and look at its spectrogram. \n\n\nsound(out1, Fs);\nspecgram(out1, 156, Fs) \n\n\n\n\nAs you can tell from its frequency response plot, this is a \"sort-of\" lowpass\nfilter, though not a very good one. \nCan you tell this by comparing the sound\nand spectrogram of the output with the input? What do the blue areas of the\nspectrogram correspond to?\n  \n\n\nRepeat from the beginning of Part B using a length 10 boxcar filter.\n  \n\n\nWhat is the relation between the length of the filter and its frequency\nresponse?\n An \ninfinite impulse response\n (IIR) filter has an unit-sample\nresponse that doesn't go to zero after a finite number of samples.  IIR filters\nare usually implemented \nrecursively\n, i.e. with non-zero \n\\(a\\)\n coefficients.\nDefine a first order recursive filter: \n\n\na=[1, -.9];\nb=[1]; \n\n\n\n\nUsing the same technique as above, look at its unit-sample and frequency\nresponse. Note that this is also a lowpass filter, with a more conventional\nfrequency response than the boxcar filter. Apply this filter to the input\nsignal. Listen to the output and plot its spectrogram. \nCan you tell by\nlistening and looking that this is a lowpass filter?\n An interesting thing\nhappens if we change the sign of \n\\(a_1\\)\n: \n\n\na = [1 .9]; \n\n\n\n\nLook at the unit-sample and frequency response of this filter. Apply it to the\ninput signal, listen to the output, and plot its spectrogram. \nWhat kind of\nfilter is this?\n \n\n\nPart C: Fancy Filtering\n\n\nTo get filters that are really effective (i.e. that pass the desired\nfrequencies with minimum distortion and reject undesired frequencies as\nstrongly as possible), we need to have a design procedure to find the optimum\nset of coefficients for a given specification. If you take ELEC 431, you will\nlearn how to do this. In the meantime, we will utilize pre-constructed\nalgorithms.  The \nButterworth\n filter is one of the classic filter designs. It\nis characterized by having the \"flattest\" possible passband. Unfortunately, its\nperformance in the stop band is decidedly mediocre. Design a \n\\(5^{th}\\)\n-order\nlowpass Butterworth filter having a cutoff frequency of 600 Hz with our 10 kHz\nsampling frequency and print out their coefficients: \n\n\n[b,a] = butter(5, 600/5000);\nb\na \n\n\n\n\nLook at the unit-sample response and the frequency response. Notice how much\ncloser this is to an ideal low pass filter. Also notice the scale on the\ny-axis. For a better comparison with previous plots, try changing this scale: \n\n\nsubplot(2,1,1)\naxis([0 1 -60 0]) \n\n\n\n\nAlso\nnote that the phase is not linear. Now apply the filter to our input\nsignal and listen to the output: \n\n\nout=filter(b,a,sig1);\nsound(out, Fs) \n\n\n\n\nWe can also design FIR filters that are significantly better than our boxcar\nfilter: \n\n\na=1\nb=fir1(5,600/5000); \n\n\n\n\nExamine the unit-sample and frequency response of this filter and apply it to\nthe reference signal. FIR filters really start to get interesting when we build\nvery long ones.  Try the same cutoff frequency with 50 coefficients: \n\n\nb=fir1(50,600/5000); \n\n\n\n\nNote that we now have a filter of order 50.  How would you like to design and\nbuild an analog (RLC) filter of this order?! \nLook at the unit-sample and\nfrequency response of this filter. What function does the unit-sample response\nremind you of?\n Note that this filter has a much more ideal shape than any of\nthe others. \n\n\nFinally apply this filter to the reference signal. \nCan you tell the\ndifference in the sound or the spectrogram between the effects of this filter\nand the length 5 filter?\n \n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\nYou will need your signals \nsig1\n and \nsig2\n for the next lab so make sure\nyou save them!",

            "text": "To get filters that are really effective (i.e. that pass the desired\nfrequencies with minimum distortion and reject undesired frequencies as\nstrongly as possible), we need to have a design procedure to find the optimum\nset of coefficients for a given specification. If you take ELEC 431, you will\nlearn how to do this. In the meantime, we will utilize pre-constructed\nalgorithms.  The  Butterworth  filter is one of the classic filter designs. It\nis characterized by having the \"flattest\" possible passband. Unfortunately, its\nperformance in the stop band is decidedly mediocre. Design a  \\(5^{th}\\) -order\nlowpass Butterworth filter having a cutoff frequency of 600 Hz with our 10 kHz\nsampling frequency and print out their coefficients:   [b,a] = butter(5, 600/5000);\nb\na   Look at the unit-sample response and the frequency response. Notice how much\ncloser this is to an ideal low pass filter. Also notice the scale on the\ny-axis. For a better comparison with previous plots, try changing this scale:   subplot(2,1,1)\naxis([0 1 -60 0])   Also\nnote that the phase is not linear. Now apply the filter to our input\nsignal and listen to the output:   out=filter(b,a,sig1);\nsound(out, Fs)   We can also design FIR filters that are significantly better than our boxcar\nfilter:   a=1\nb=fir1(5,600/5000);   Examine the unit-sample and frequency response of this filter and apply it to\nthe reference signal. FIR filters really start to get interesting when we build\nvery long ones.  Try the same cutoff frequency with 50 coefficients:   b=fir1(50,600/5000);   Note that we now have a filter of order 50.  How would you like to design and\nbuild an analog (RLC) filter of this order?!  Look at the unit-sample and\nfrequency response of this filter. What function does the unit-sample response\nremind you of?  Note that this filter has a much more ideal shape than any of\nthe others.   Finally apply this filter to the reference signal.  Can you tell the\ndifference in the sound or the spectrogram between the effects of this filter\nand the length 5 filter?

It has an anode pin\n(the longer one), which should be connected to the higher voltage, and a\ncathode pin (the shorter one), connected to a lower voltage.  Current only\nflows from anode to cathode, which causes it to light up.\n\n\nQuad DIP Switch\n\n\nThe quad DIP (Dual-In-Line Package) switch used here is a package with four\nswitches inside. Each switch has two statuses. When a switch is turned off (at\nthe lower position), the two ends of it are isolated.  When it is turned on,\nthe two ends are shorted.\n\n\n7400 (74HC00) NAND gate\n\n\nA NAND gate performs the function NOT AND. The circuit symbol looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut let\u2019s first understand the AND function, whose circuit symbol looks like\nthis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you AND inputs \n\\(A\\)\n and \n\\(B\\)\n, the output will be true only if both \n\\(A\\)\n \nand\n \n\\(B\\)\n are\ntrue. With two inputs, you have four possible combinations possible: \n\\(A\\)\n and \n\\(B\\)\n\nare both false; \n\\(A\\)\n is false while \n\\(B\\)\n is true; \n\\(A\\)\n is true while \n\\(B\\)\n is false; or \n\\(A\\)\n\nand \n\\(B\\)\n are both true.\n\n\nA NAND gate inverts the result of an AND operation. So while an AND operation\nonly outputs true when both \n\\(A\\)\n and \n\\(B\\)\n are true, a NAND operation will output\ntrue for all combinations \nexcept\n when both \n\\(A\\)\n and \n\\(B\\)\n are true.

In other words, the output\nis true only when exclusively \n\\(A\\)\n or exclusively \n\\(B\\)\n is true. See the truth\ntable below for an XOR operation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\nB\n\n\nA XOR B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe XOR IC we will use has the following pin diagram.

Its purpose is to form the arithmetic sum of two binary numbers. In\nthis lab, we will be building a one-bit full-adder, which adds two 1-bit binary\nnumbers as well as a carry bit. The result will be a 1-bit sum and a 1-bit\ncarry term. In this section we will see how to design a binary adder out of\nbasic logic gates.\n\n\nLet's first understand a little more about the binary system. Binary is\ncalculated in base 2. If we have \n\\(n\\)\n input bits, we have \n\\(2^n\\)\n possible\ncombinations, and can represent up to the decimal value \n\\(2^n-1\\)\n, starting\nwith decimal value 0. In our case, we have three 1-bit inputs, so we have\n\n\\(2^n = 8\\)\n possible input combinations.\n\n\nTo understand binary addition, let's look at an example. The steps are similar\nto a decimal summation. For example if we are adding \n\\(1101\\)\n and \n\\(0110\\)\n, we sum\nup the column beginning at right, and carry over the extra to the next column.\nA carry bit results when there are 2 or more 1's in the input. The sum\n\n\\(1101+0110=10011\\)\n is written as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, a multi-bit summation can be computed with several individual\naddition steps. Each step adds up one column of three 1-bit numbers and\nprovides a carry to the next column. (For the first column on the right, the\ncarry could be filled in as a zero).\n\n\nA circuit for this one-column adder is the one that we will build in this lab.\n\n\nLet's represent the two 1-bit inputs as \n\\(x\\)\n and \n\\(y\\)\n, the carry as \n\\(z\\)\n, and the\ntwo outputs as sum bit \n\\(S\\)\n, and the final carry bit \n\\(C\\)\n. The truth table is\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo build a logic circuit, we want to formulate a single logical expression\nwhose result matches the truth table for all cases of input combinations. Since\nwe have two outputs \n\\(S\\)\n and \n\\(C\\)\n, we need two logical expressions.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nInstead of indicating logical operations with the gate name (i.e., \n\\(x\\)\n XOR\n\n\\(y\\)\n) there are common symbols that are used in logical expressions to\nindicate the logical operation. Given two inputs \n\\(x\\)\n and \n\\(y\\)\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nSymbolic Expression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n AND \n\\(y\\)\n\n\n\\(xy\\)\n or \n\\(x \\bullet y\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n OR \n\\(y\\)\n\n\n\\(x \\vee y\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOT \n\\(x\\)\n\n\n\\(\\lnot x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n NAND \n\\(y\\)\n\n\n\\(\\lnot ( x \\bullet y )\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n NOR \n\\(y\\)\n\n\n\\(\\lnot ( x \\vee y )\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n XOR \n\\(y\\)\n\n\n\\(x \\bigoplus y\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n XNOR \n\\(y\\)\n\n\n\\(\\lnot (x\\bigoplus y)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's start with formulating an expression for output \n\\(S\\)\n. Redraw the full adder\ntruth table and add two additional columns, labeling one as \n\\(x \\bigoplus y\\)\n and\nthe other as \n\\((x \\bigoplus y) \\bigoplus z\\)\n. \nFill in the new columns of your\ntruth table and show that\n\n\n\\[\nS = (x \\bigoplus y) \\bigoplus z\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n\n\n\\(y\\)\n\n\n\\(z\\)\n\n\n\\(x\\bigoplus y\\)\n\n\n\\(\\left( x\\bigoplus y \\right)\\bigoplus z\\)\n\n\nC\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, show that the output \n\\(C = (x \\bullet y) \\vee (x \\bigoplus y) \\bullet z\\)\n.\n\n\nFrom our expressions, it looks like the output \n\\(S\\)\n will require two XOR gates,\nand \n\\(C\\)\n will require additional 2 ANDs and an OR. A circuit diagram for this is\nshown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, building this circuit will require using three different ICs, two of\nwhich we don\u2019t have.\n\n\nSo now we will apply a very useful law called DeMorgan's Law to our\nexpressions, which states:\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx \\bullet y \n= \\lnot (x \\vee y) \\\\\nx \\vee y \n= \\lnot (x \\bullet y) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nDeMorgan's Law implies that any AND gate can be substituted with an OR and a\nNOT gate, and vice versa: any OR gate can be substituted with an AND and a NOT\ngate. Applying DeMorgan's Law to the expression for \n\\(C\\)\n and using some\nsimplification steps, we see that \n\\(C\\)\n could be obtained with just NAND and XOR\ngates: \n\n\n\\[\nC = \\lnot \n        \\left( \n            \\lnot (x \\bullet y) \\bullet \\lnot \n                \\left( \n                \\left(x \\bigoplus y \\right) \\bullet z \n                \\right) \n        \\right)\n\\]\nCreate a truth table to prove this to yourself.\n The circuit for this\nequation is below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C: Constructing the Full-Adder\n\n\nLet\u2019s build this full-adder on our breadboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace the DIP switch on your breadboard, and set all the switches to the\n    off position. Let switch 1 (SW1) be x, SW2 be y, and SW3 be z.  Wire the\n    following connections to each of your switches as shown below. The pins on\n    the side of the off position should be wired to ground. The 330-\u2126 resistor\n    acts to prevent a short between power supply and ground when the switch is\n    closed. TTL (transistor-transistor logic) indicates where you will make the\n    connection to your logic gates in Step 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, insert the NAND IC (74HC00) and XOR IC (74HC86) on your breadboard,\n    checking that the notches on the ICs both face the same direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWire \n\\(V_{cc}\\)\n and GND for the two ICs, where \n\\(V_{cc} = 5V\\)\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWire the logic circuit together with the pin assignments as shown\n    below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to include some indicator of what our Sum and Carry output is. For\n    this we will use LEDs, that will light up when the output is 1. Wire the\n    following connections to your S and C outputs. (The resistor in series\n    avoids excessive voltage drop across the LED).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour full-adder is done! Now test if it works, by checking all possible\n    input combinations from your full-adder truth table. \nTake a photo for\n    each input combination (showing switch and LEDs) to include in your\n    report.",

            "text": "The binary adder circuit is an important building block of digital arithmetic\ncircuits. Its purpose is to form the arithmetic sum of two binary numbers. In\nthis lab, we will be building a one-bit full-adder, which adds two 1-bit binary\nnumbers as well as a carry bit. The result will be a 1-bit sum and a 1-bit\ncarry term. In this section we will see how to design a binary adder out of\nbasic logic gates.  Let's first understand a little more about the binary system. Binary is\ncalculated in base 2. If we have  \\(n\\)  input bits, we have  \\(2^n\\)  possible\ncombinations, and can represent up to the decimal value  \\(2^n-1\\) , starting\nwith decimal value 0. In our case, we have three 1-bit inputs, so we have \\(2^n = 8\\)  possible input combinations.  To understand binary addition, let's look at an example. The steps are similar\nto a decimal summation. For example if we are adding  \\(1101\\)  and  \\(0110\\) , we sum\nup the column beginning at right, and carry over the extra to the next column.\nA carry bit results when there are 2 or more 1's in the input. The sum \\(1101+0110=10011\\)  is written as shown below.     As you can see, a multi-bit summation can be computed with several individual\naddition steps. Each step adds up one column of three 1-bit numbers and\nprovides a carry to the next column. (For the first column on the right, the\ncarry could be filled in as a zero).  A circuit for this one-column adder is the one that we will build in this lab.  Let's represent the two 1-bit inputs as  \\(x\\)  and  \\(y\\) , the carry as  \\(z\\) , and the\ntwo outputs as sum bit  \\(S\\) , and the final carry bit  \\(C\\) . The truth table is\nbelow.     To build a logic circuit, we want to formulate a single logical expression\nwhose result matches the truth table for all cases of input combinations. Since\nwe have two outputs  \\(S\\)  and  \\(C\\) , we need two logical expressions.   Note  Instead of indicating logical operations with the gate name (i.e.,  \\(x\\)  XOR \\(y\\) ) there are common symbols that are used in logical expressions to\nindicate the logical operation. Given two inputs  \\(x\\)  and  \\(y\\) :     Name  Symbolic Expression      \\(x\\)  AND  \\(y\\)  \\(xy\\)  or  \\(x \\bullet y\\)    \\(x\\)  OR  \\(y\\)  \\(x \\vee y\\)    NOT  \\(x\\)  \\(\\lnot x\\)    \\(x\\)  NAND  \\(y\\)  \\(\\lnot ( x \\bullet y )\\)    \\(x\\)  NOR  \\(y\\)  \\(\\lnot ( x \\vee y )\\)    \\(x\\)  XOR  \\(y\\)  \\(x \\bigoplus y\\)    \\(x\\)  XNOR  \\(y\\)  \\(\\lnot (x\\bigoplus y)\\)      Let's start with formulating an expression for output  \\(S\\) . Redraw the full adder\ntruth table and add two additional columns, labeling one as  \\(x \\bigoplus y\\)  and\nthe other as  \\((x \\bigoplus y) \\bigoplus z\\) .  Fill in the new columns of your\ntruth table and show that  \\[\nS = (x \\bigoplus y) \\bigoplus z\n\\]    \\(x\\)  \\(y\\)  \\(z\\)  \\(x\\bigoplus y\\)  \\(\\left( x\\bigoplus y \\right)\\bigoplus z\\)  C  S      0  0  0    0  0    0  0  1    0  1    0  1  0    0  1    0  1  1    1  0    1  0  0    0  1    1  0  1    1  0    1  1  0    1  0    1  1  1    1  1     Similarly, show that the output  \\(C = (x \\bullet y) \\vee (x \\bigoplus y) \\bullet z\\) .  From our expressions, it looks like the output  \\(S\\)  will require two XOR gates,\nand  \\(C\\)  will require additional 2 ANDs and an OR. A circuit diagram for this is\nshown below.     However, building this circuit will require using three different ICs, two of\nwhich we don\u2019t have.  So now we will apply a very useful law called DeMorgan's Law to our\nexpressions, which states:  \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx \\bullet y  = \\lnot (x \\vee y) \\\\\nx \\vee y  = \\lnot (x \\bullet y) \n\\end{aligned}\n\\] DeMorgan's Law implies that any AND gate can be substituted with an OR and a\nNOT gate, and vice versa: any OR gate can be substituted with an AND and a NOT\ngate. Applying DeMorgan's Law to the expression for  \\(C\\)  and using some\nsimplification steps, we see that  \\(C\\)  could be obtained with just NAND and XOR\ngates:   \\[\nC = \\lnot \n        \\left( \n            \\lnot (x \\bullet y) \\bullet \\lnot \n                \\left( \n                \\left(x \\bigoplus y \\right) \\bullet z \n                \\right) \n        \\right)\n\\] Create a truth table to prove this to yourself.
