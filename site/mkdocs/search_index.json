            "text": "ELEC 240 Lab\n\n\n\n\nThe Breadboard\n\n\nThe Concept\n\n\nWhen building a \"permanent circuit\" the components can be \"grown\" together (as\nin an integrated circuit), soldered together (as on a printed circuit board),\nor held together by screws and clamps (as in house wiring). In lab, we want\nsomething that is easy to assemble and easy to change. We also want something\nthat can be used with the same components that \"real\" circuits use. Most of\nthese components have pieces of wire or metal tabs sticking out of them to form\ntheir terminals.\n\n\nHow it Works\n\n\nThe heart of the solderless breadboard is a small metal clip that looks like\nthis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of the pairs of fingers is mechanically independent from the others, so we\ncan insert the end of a wire between any pair without reducing the tension in\nany of the other fingers. However when we insert a wire between any pair, we\nelectrically connect all metal fingers together.\n\n\nTo make a breadboard, an array of these clips is embedded in a plastic block\nwhich holds them in place and insulates them from each other, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the size and arrangement of the clips, we get either a socket\nstrip or a bus strip. The socket strip is used for connecting components\ntogether. It has two rows of short (5 contact) clips arranged one above\nanother, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bus strip is used to distribute power and ground voltages through the\ncircuit. It has has six long (24 contact) clips arranged lengthwise, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the bus strip is not electrically connected in the center. If you\nwant a single, continuous bus, you will have to bridge that central gap\nyourself.\n\n\nWhen we combine two socket strips, three bus strips, power connectors, power\ntie points, interface modules, and an interface connector on a large printed\ncircuit board, we get the complete breadboard:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In this picture we have replaced the plastic covers, hiding the connection\nbetween the terminal points).\n\n\nThe breadboard lets us connect components together and by wiring the bus strips\nto the binding posts and the binding posts to the power supply, to connect the\npower supply to the circuit. Now what we need is a way to bring connections\nfrom the rest of the instruments into the breadboard.",

            "text": "The heart of the solderless breadboard is a small metal clip that looks like\nthis:     Each of the pairs of fingers is mechanically independent from the others, so we\ncan insert the end of a wire between any pair without reducing the tension in\nany of the other fingers. However when we insert a wire between any pair, we\nelectrically connect all metal fingers together.  To make a breadboard, an array of these clips is embedded in a plastic block\nwhich holds them in place and insulates them from each other, like this:     Depending on the size and arrangement of the clips, we get either a socket\nstrip or a bus strip. The socket strip is used for connecting components\ntogether. It has two rows of short (5 contact) clips arranged one above\nanother, like this:     The bus strip is used to distribute power and ground voltages through the\ncircuit. It has has six long (24 contact) clips arranged lengthwise, like this:     Note that the bus strip is not electrically connected in the center. If you\nwant a single, continuous bus, you will have to bridge that central gap\nyourself.  When we combine two socket strips, three bus strips, power connectors, power\ntie points, interface modules, and an interface connector on a large printed\ncircuit board, we get the complete breadboard:     (In this picture we have replaced the plastic covers, hiding the connection\nbetween the terminal points).  The breadboard lets us connect components together and by wiring the bus strips\nto the binding posts and the binding posts to the power supply, to connect the\npower supply to the circuit.

We will use only one or two of the interface components at a time\nand will build circuits consisting of 2 or 3 components which are disassembled\nat the end of lab. As we get closer to the final project, we will be\nconstructing more complicated circuits having more external connections. Since\nsome of these will perform functions needed in subsequent Labs, we will want to\nleave them in place on the breadboard for future use. We will need a plan for\norganizing the layout and wiring on the breadboard and interface board.\n\n\nThere are several aspects to this organization ranging from small details to\nthe big picture.\n\n\nColor Coding\n\n\nYour wire kit contains an assortment of different colored wires. You could just\npick pieces of wire at random, or you could try to use the different colors to\ndesignate different signals. There aren't enough colors for each signal to have\nits own, but you can use different colors to denote different classes of\nsignals.\n\n\nOne set of signals you should color code are power and ground. In particular,\nyou should have a different color for \n\\(+15V\\)\n, \n\\(-15V\\)\n, and ground. You should\nnot use any of these colors for other signals. It would be nice to use\n\"standard\" colors for these, but unfortunately there are several competing\nstandards. One color that nearly everyone agrees on is that red should be the\npositive power supply voltage. Most automotive and electronic wiring uses black\nto denote ground. Electronic wiring which uses black for ground often uses blue\nfor the negative supply. However, our power supply and breadboard use green to\ndenote ground (the convention used in house wiring) and use black to denote the\nnegative supply.\n\n\nSo we have two possible \"standard\" color codes for power: \n\n\n\n\nred\u00a0=\u00a0+, green\u00a0=\u00a0gnd, black\u00a0=\u00a0-\n\n\nred\u00a0=\u00a0+, black\u00a0=\u00a0gnd, blue\u00a0=\u00a0- \n\n\n\n\nYou could use either of these, or make up your own.\n\n\nAnother useful thing to color code would be the wires or \"probes\" from the\ninterface board connector. That way you can tell which wire is \nCH1\n of the\nscope or which is the function generator output without having to trace from\none end of the wire to the other.\n\n\nPower Bussing\n\n\nThere are a few different ways to figure out the orientation of an Integrated\nChip (IC) such as an an \nop-amp\n.  The first step\nis to figure out where pin 1 is. The remaining pins are in chronological order\nand increment in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n\nIf pin 1 is in the lower left corner, then the writing on the package reads\nleft to right. Alternately, some ICs will have a dot above pin 1.  A third\nindication is a semi-circle indentation on the top end of the chip - pin 1 will\nbe to the left of it.\n\n\nTo simplify power wiring, we should run the positive bus above each socket\nstrip and the negative bus below. Doing this and running ground on the\nremaining buses gives us the following layout for power:\n\n\n\n\nInterface Board Connector Assignments\n\n\nSome of the connectors on the Interface Board are dedicated to a single\nfunction (e.g. the telephone handset or the sound card). Others (e.g.\nthe BNC and phone jacks) are more flexible and may be connected to a\nvariety of signal sources or destinations. It will be helpful to\nestablish standard assignments for these connectors as well.\n\n\nIn the instructions and photographs, we will be using the following\nassignment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnector\n\n\nSocket Pin\n\n\nSignal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ1-1\n\n\n1\n\n\nOscilloscope channel 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ1-2\n\n\n2\n\n\nOscilloscope channel 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ1-3\n\n\n3\n\n\nFunction generator output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall Layout\n\n\nThis final project will be a fairly complex circuit. Good engineering practice\nis to break down a complex system into a number of simple subsystems, each of\nwhich performs a single, well-defined function.\n\n\nIn the unlikely event that your circuit does not work perfectly the first time\nyou turn it on, it will make it easier for you (and your labbie) to debug it if\neach of these subcircuits is laid out (neatly, of course) on its own little\npatch of breadboard and is connected to the other subcircuits in such a way\nthat it may be easilly disconnected from them for testing in isolation.\n\n\nOne additional advantage of a tidy layout with short wires is that it is more\nrugged. Remember that you will have to transport your circuit from your lab\nbench to the testing station without parts falling off or loops of wire getting\ncaught and mysteriously pulled loose.\n\n\nReal World Circuit Problems\n\n\nOn paper all our components are ideal and no components exist where we don't\ndraw them. In an actual circuit, things are not quite so tidy: wires have non\nzero resistance and inductance, sources have output resistance, parasitic\ncapacitances and mutual inductances exist between wires, and a host of other\ngremlins. In addition, although we are only applying input signals up to a few\n10s of kHz, the active devices (op amps and transistors) we use have gain at\nfrequencies up to a few MHz (op amps) or 100s of MHz (transistors). This means\nthat all of the \"little\" pieces of wire can become fairly effective antennas,\nradiating energy to (and receiving from) the rest of the world, and more\nsignificantly, to other parts of the circuit.\n\n\nWhat all this means is that a circuit which is wired correctly topologically\nmay fail to function as expected. Although we can't eliminate all of these\neffects, we can do some things to minimize them.  Here are a few.\n\n\nLayout\n\n\nTry to arrange your layout so that each function is grouped together in a\nsingle area of the board and so that stages that are connected together are\nclose to each other. This will allow connections to be made with shorter wires.\nAlso try to avoid having high level signals near low level stages.\n\n\nTwisted Pairs\n\n\nOne way to reduce unwanted coupling between different signals in your circuit\nis to use \ntwisted pairs\n, i.e. a pair of wires twisted together with one wire\nconnected to ground and the other carrying the signal.\n\n\nTo make a twisted pair, select two wires having an aesthetically pleasing\ncombination of colors and twist them together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could use twisted pair wires for connections between the interface board\nand your circuit, as well as any other long runs of wire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse one wire for the signal and connect the other to ground, at both ends of\nthe run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome signals (e.g. the photodiode input) don't have a ground. In this case, you\ncan still use a twisted pair, but neither wire will be grounded.\n\n\nRouting\n\n\nTwisted pair or not, try to keep wires carrying high level signals (large\nvoltages or currents) (e.g. the LED or earphone) away from those carrying low\nlevel signals (e.g. the photodiode or dynamic microphone).  A corollary to this\nis to keep outputs away from inputs, especially in the same subcircuit. It's\nbetter for wires to cross at right angles than to run parallel to each other.\n\n\nBypass Capacitors\n\n\nAnother path for unwanted coupling between stages is via the power supply. To\nreduce this, use some of your electrolytic capacitors as \nbypass capacitors\n,\ni.e. connect them between the power supply voltages and ground (be sure to\nobserve correct polarity on the electrolytic capacitors - the shorter wire is\nusually negative polarity, and you will also see a neg sign above this wire).\nIdeally each op amp should be bypassed, but you may be able to get by with a\nsingle pair of capacitors for the entire circuit.\n\n\nWiring Technique\n\n\nThe basic idea of wiring on a solderless breadboard is simple: just stick the\nends of the component leads or wires into the holes. But like any seemingly\nsimple process, there are a few subtleties that can make the difference between\nsuccess and failure.\n\n\nFirst a note of caution. The material that the clips inside the breadboard are\nmade of (so called \"nickel silver\") is a compromise between good conductivity,\ncorrosion resistance, and springiness. In particular the elastic limit is\nconsiderably less than of a good steel spring and if spread too far, can be\npermanently distorted. To avoid deforming the connector clips:\n\n\n\n\nUse only the wire that is supplied to you (24 gauge, solid\n  telephone cable).\n\n\nUse only components with small diameter leads (1/4 watt resistors,\n  capacitors, ICs, etc.).\n\n\nDo not insert power resistor leads into the breadboard.  When using power\n\n\ntransistors in the breadboard, use your pliers to\n  twist each lead 90 degrees so that they are gripped by the broad face rather\n  than the narrow edge.\n\n\nNever insert more than one wire in a hole.\n\n\n\n\nWith the health of our breadboard assured, there are a few more things we can\ndo to make sure that our connections are good ones.\n\n\n\n\nStrip about 7\u00a0mm of insulation from each end of a piece of wire.\n  Less than that raises the risk that insulation will be forced between the\n  fingers of the clip. More leaves bare wire exposed that can short to adjacent\n  components. Don't try to jam the wires far down into the breadboard because\n  it can scratch the bottom and damage the connection. One exception: strip\n  about 15\u00a0mm from the end of a wire that will be clamped in one of the binding\n  posts. Make sure copper is showing on both sides of the post when it is\n  clamped down.\n\n\nWhen inserting a wire or component, use your needle nosed pliers\n  rather than your fingers to hold it. Grip the wire or lead about 10\u00a0mm from\n  the end and press straight down.\n\n\nIf the end of a wire becomes kinked, cut it off or use your pliers\n  to straighten it.",

Good engineering practice\nis to break down a complex system into a number of simple subsystems, each of\nwhich performs a single, well-defined function.

            "text": "The basic idea of wiring on a solderless breadboard is simple: just stick the\nends of the component leads or wires into the holes. But like any seemingly\nsimple process, there are a few subtleties that can make the difference between\nsuccess and failure.  First a note of caution. The material that the clips inside the breadboard are\nmade of (so called \"nickel silver\") is a compromise between good conductivity,\ncorrosion resistance, and springiness. In particular the elastic limit is\nconsiderably less than of a good steel spring and if spread too far, can be\npermanently distorted. To avoid deforming the connector clips:   Use only the wire that is supplied to you (24 gauge, solid\n  telephone cable).  Use only components with small diameter leads (1/4 watt resistors,\n  capacitors, ICs, etc.).  Do not insert power resistor leads into the breadboard.  When using power  transistors in the breadboard, use your pliers to\n  twist each lead 90 degrees so that they are gripped by the broad face rather\n  than the narrow edge.  Never insert more than one wire in a hole.   With the health of our breadboard assured, there are a few more things we can\ndo to make sure that our connections are good ones.   Strip about 7\u00a0mm of insulation from each end of a piece of wire.\n  Less than that raises the risk that insulation will be forced between the\n  fingers of the clip. More leaves bare wire exposed that can short to adjacent\n  components. Don't try to jam the wires far down into the breadboard because\n  it can scratch the bottom and damage the connection. One exception: strip\n  about 15\u00a0mm from the end of a wire that will be clamped in one of the binding\n  posts. Make sure copper is showing on both sides of the post when it is\n  clamped down.  When inserting a wire or component, use your needle nosed pliers\n  rather than your fingers to hold it. Grip the wire or lead about 10\u00a0mm from\n  the end and press straight down.  If the end of a wire becomes kinked, cut it off or use your pliers\n  to straighten it.",

The two most common ways are:  \n\n\n\n\nby cooking you (the hard way)\n\n\nby disrupting your nervous system (the easy way)\n\n\n\n\nThe good news is that in ELEC 240 laboratory, you will not be exposed to\ndangerous voltage levels \nunless\n you mishandle the equipment. Before we get\nclose enough to the equipment to mishandle it, let's take a closer look at just\nhow you can get hurt if you do.\n\n\nWhat strength voltages and currents are harmful?\n\n\nElectricity is potentially the most dangerous commodity in general use by the\npublic today. In spite of this, less than 1 percent of the 100,000 accidental\ndeaths which occur annually in the United States are directly attributable to\nelectrocution. Considering the ever-increasing use of electricity in the home\nand industry, we should be alert to protect and better this excellent safety\nrecord. An understanding of the effects of electric shock, high-frequency\nheating, and other electrically produced physiological phenomena on the human\nbody should be part of basic knowledge. We present a brief survey of these\ntopics in the hope that you will become aware of the very real dangers inherent\nin the application of electrical phenomena. We shall consider these dangers in\neach frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum - from the power\nfrequencies to cosmic rays.\n\n\nPower Frequencies\n\n\nElectric Shock.\n The ratio of fatalities to injuries for electric shock\naccidents is very high in comparison to the corresponding figure for all other\naccidents. \nDeath due to electric shock is fast and permanent.\n\n\nShock Sensitivity.\n Because of a person's highly developed nervous system,\nthey are sensitive to very small currents. For example, the tongue will give a\nsensation of taste at currents as low as 45 microamperes. The threshold of\nfeeling on the hand is found to be on the order of 5\u00a0mA DC and 1\u00a0mA at 60\u00a0Hz.\nThe shocks due to currents at this threshold are usually considered annoying\nrather than dangerous.  However, they are startling when not anticipated, and\nmay cause involuntary movement that sometimes results in serious injury. As the\nvalue of current increases above the threshold, one becomes aware of sensations\nof heat and contraction of the muscles. Sensations of pain develop and\nvoluntary control of the muscles in the path of the current becomes\nincreasingly difficult. Finally a value of current is reached where the victim\n\"freezes\" to the circuit. The value of current at which a victim can just\nrelease the electrode is referred to as \"let-go\" current. The average let-go\ncurrent for healthy people is about 16\u00a0mA rms (60\u00a0Hz). It is important to note\nthat let-go currents of as low as 5\u00a0mA have been measured. Experience has shown\nthat an individual can withstand, with no ill aftereffect except for possible\nsore muscles, repeated exposure to their let-go current for at least the time\nrequired for them to release the conductor.\n\n\nEffect of Frequency and Waveform.\n Gradually increasing direct current\nproduces sensations of internal heating. Sudden changes of current, however,\nproduce powerful muscular contractions, and interruption of the current causes\nvery severe shocks. Experiments at 10\u00a0kHz indicate that the let-go current is\napproximately 3 times the 60\u00a0Hz value. For non-sinusoidal waveforms, the peak\nvalue seems to be the critical factor in muscular stimulation.\n\n\nNature of Bodily Damage.\n As far as gross electrical effects are concerned,\nthe body can be represented by the equivalent circuit shown in the figure\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outer skin (epidermis) is roughly 0.1\u00a0mm thick and has a resistance of the\norder of \n\\(10^5 \\Omega cm^2\\)\n when dry. The inner skin (dermis)\nand the internal organs are of relatively low resistance because of their high\nsalinity. It is generally believed that the effects of electric shock are due\nto the current flowing through the body. Electrical burns are a result of\nheating the skin. The immediate formation of blisters at the point of contact\ncauses the skin to lose its protective resistance and more serious damage may\nthus occur. Burns of this nature penetrate quite deeply and, while they seldom\nbecome infected, heal very slowly. Electrical current is most dangerous when\nvital organs are in its path through the body. Current may cause stoppage of\nbreathing due to excessive contraction of the chest muscles.  Temporary\nparalysis of respiration may also occur if the current produces a block in the\nnervous system that prevents signals from reaching the lungs. In either case,\nit is imperative that an approved form of artificial respiration be applied\nimmediately and continued without interruption until competent medical\nexamination has been made.\n\n\nVentricular Fibrillation.\n Passage of electrical current through the heart\nis considered particularly dangerous. The heart exerts its pumping action as a\nresult of complex rhythmic motion controlled by periodic electrical impulses to\nthe muscle tissue. The regularity of this motion assures proper blood\ncirculation. Electric current passing through the heart completely upsets this\nrhythmic motion and results in random muscular contractions. The heart no\nlonger effectively pumps, but quivers like so much \"Jell-O\". This condition is\nknown as ventricular fibrillation and is nearly always fatal. Energy of the\nimpulse of current is responsible for this hazard and an estimate of the danger\nthreshold for fibrillation is 13.5\u00a0watt-seconds.\n\n\nRadio Frequencies\n\n\nAt frequencies above the power range, the primary bodily damage results from\ndielectric heating. Heating also occurs from both conduction current and\nradiation. The temperature of the human body is maintained remarkably constant\nby very complex temperature regulating mechanisms.  These mechanisms,\ncoordinated by the brain, control temperature by regulating the production and\nloss of heat. Circulation of bodily fluids contributes to the distribution of\nthe heat. The change in diameter of the blood vessels, for example, regulates\nthe volume and velocity of flow. However, not all areas are equally well\nregulated, and it is possible for local heating to occur. Such local heating is\napt to be dangerous, particularly if vital organs are involved. A differential\nof \n\\(5^\\circ\\text{C}\\)\n maintained for a sufficient time may be injurious or even\nlethal. Testes, for example, undergo degenerate changes with temperature rises\nas low as \n\\(1^\\circ\\text{C}\\)\n. The amount of bodily temperature rise depends on\nthe specific area exposed and its efficiency of heat elimination. Other factors\ncontributing to temperature rise are intensity and the duration of exposure. At\nfrequencies below the microwave region \n\\(f \n 1000\\text{MHz})\\)\n, about 40 percent\nof the incident energy is absorbed. These frequencies cause deep (internal)\nheating and are very dangerous: such heating is not well indicated by sensory\nelements of the skin.  A tolerance figure of \n\\(0.001\\text{ }{watt}\\text{\n}{cm}^2\\)\n for long-term exposures has been considered adequate. Surface burns\nresulting from R.F.  currents are similar to those encountered at lower\nfrequencies.\n\n\nMicrowave Frequencies\n\n\nThe effects of the lower microwave frequencies are similar to those of radio\nfrequencies and a comparable tolerance figure for exposure should not be\nexceeded. As the frequency increases \n\\(f \n 3000\\text{MHz}\\)\n, the incident energy\nis absorbed by the skin with an efficiency of 40 to 50 percent. The effects of\nsuch radiation are much the same as is encountered with infrared and sunlight.\nThe possibility of the formation of eye cataracts must be considered at\nmicrowave frequencies. These cataracts result in impairment of vision or even\nblindness as a result of the formation of a white cloud in the normally\ntransparent cornea of the eye. Cataracts are thought to occur in a manner\nanalogous to the formation of the \"white\" of an egg upon heating. Experiments\nwith rabbits have indicated that cataracts have formed in 3 to 9 days following\na single 15 minute exposure to a 100 watt source of 12\u00a0cm waves at a distance\nof 5\u00a0cm.  While the exposure indicated here is probably extreme, care should be\ntaken when working with high-powered radar sets.\n\n\nInfrared, Visible Light and Ultraviolet Frequencies\n\n\nThe immediate effects of this band of frequencies are popularly known as\nsunburn. The eye, however, is particularly susceptible to excess exposure at\nthese frequencies. Such exposure can easily occur when observing an electric\narc without protection. This may result in hemorrhages of the choriod (the\nouter lining of the retina) and actual destruction of portions of the retina\nitself. In addition, actual immediate pain may be encountered because of\nviolent contractions induced in the iris. Photophthalmia (temporary snow\nblindness) is due to ultraviolet radiation following undue exposure to\nsunlight, an electric arc, or a sun lamp.\n\n\nX-Rays and Nuclear Radiation\n\n\nThe effects of this portion of the electromagnetic spectrum of the human body\nare still being studied. It has been found that the amount of energy absorbed\nby the tissue during exposure is the most important consideration. Damage to\nthe reproductive organs has been found to be the most sensitive indication of\nexcessive exposure. Controlled experiments with mice exposed to fast neutron\nradiation from an atomic reactor indicate the type of damage sustained by\nliving animals. During the first 9 months of continuous exposure, no visible\ndifferences were noted. The mice then began to lose weight and gradually lose\nhair. Eye cataracts developed after a year and death followed. Limited exposure\nto nuclear radiation resulted in a shortened life span. We have yet to\ncompletely determine the consequences of the atomic bombs of World War II in\nterms of its biological effects. For this reason, plus the fact that the latent\nperiod between exposure and detection of damage may run into months and years,\nit behooves us to take all precautions against X-Ray and nuclear radiation.",

These cataracts result in impairment of vision or even\nblindness as a result of the formation of a white cloud in the normally\ntransparent cornea of the eye. Cataracts are thought to occur in a manner\nanalogous to the formation of the \"white\" of an egg upon heating. Experiments\nwith rabbits have indicated that cataracts have formed in 3 to 9 days following\na single 15 minute exposure to a 100 watt source of 12\u00a0cm waves at a distance\nof 5\u00a0cm.  While the exposure indicated here is probably extreme, care should be\ntaken when working with high-powered radar sets.",

Let's\nfind out how the current and voltage of our light bulb are related.\n\n\nFor this measurement, we will need to vary the voltage applied to the bulb, so\nwe will need a variable voltage source.

            "text": "### ELEC 240 Lab # Introduction In the last 2 labs we looked at\nvarious kinds of signals: DC, sinusoidal, square waves, speech, etc. But\nto build our optical communication system, we will have to do more than\nlook. We need to be able to manipulate signals so that we can impress\nthe desired information onto a \"carrier\" signal to transmit it and then\nextract the information from the received signal. Another term for this\nsignal manipulation is *signal processing*. For this lab you will need\nto be familiar with MATLAB, so it is advised to look over some online\ntutorials. The following figure shows the basic voltage divider circuit:\n![voltage divider](figs/img160.png)\nfor which we have the familiar relation: $v_\\text{out} =\n\\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} v_\\text{in}$ or\n$\\frac{v_\\text{out}}{v_\\text{in}} = \\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$.\nIf $R_1$ and $R_2$ are fixed then the output voltage is a constant\nfraction of the input, i.e. we have a fixed attenuator. If either or\nboth of them vary, we have a variable attenuator (e.g. a volume\ncontrol). If $v_\\text{in}$ is constant and one or both of $R_1$\nor $R_2$ vary with time, then $v_\\text{out}$ will be a function\nof time, following the change in $R$. If either or both of $R_1$\nand $R_2$ vary with frequency (i.e. they are impedances rather than\npure resistances) then the attenuation (or transfer function) will be a\nfunction of frequency, i.e. we have a *filter*. Finally, if one or the\nother of $R_1$ or $R_2$ is non-linear, then the input-output\nrelation will reflect that nonlinearity. If we replace resistances\n$R_1$ and $R_2$ by impedances $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ and use the\nphasor representation ($V_\\text{in}$ and $V_\\text{out}$) for the\ninput and output voltages, then the voltage divider relation still\nholds. We define the ratio of the output voltage phasor to the input\nvoltage phasor to be the *transfer function*:\n$H(f)\\equiv\\frac{V_\\text{out}}{V_\\text{in}} = \\frac{Z_2}{Z_1 +\nZ_2}$\nFor example if we replace $R_2$ with a capacitor, we get the\nfollowing circuit:\n![lowpass](figs/img161.png)\nfor which $H(f)=\\frac{V_\\text{out}}{V_\\text{in}} =\n\\frac{Z_2}{Z_1 + Z_2} = \\frac{1/j2\\pi fC}{(1/j2\\pi fC)+R} =\n\\frac{1}{j2\\pi fRC+1}$. Since $H(f)$ is close to one for small\nvalues of $f$ and goes to zero for large $f$ (i.e. it passes low\nfrequencies) we call this circuit a *low pass filter*.",

With\ncareful design, this interaction can be minimized or accounted for. If\nignored it can reduce the performance of the system, or keep it from\nworking altogether.****\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more accurate model of the system we measured would be:\\\n\n{width=\"369\" height=\"95\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on your measurements, \nwhat are the output resistance (R~S~) of\nthe function generator and the input resistance (R~L~) of the scope?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C: The Potentiometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA potentiometer (pot for short) is a fixed value resistor with a\nthird, movable contact or \nslider\n which may be positioned anywhere\nalong the resistive element. If we represent the position of the slider\nby \u03b1, where \u03b1 varies between 0 (fully counterclockwise) and 1 (fully\nclockwise), then the resistance between the lower end of the resistor\nand the slider will be \u03b1R and between the slider and the upper end will\nbe (1-\u03b1)R, where R is the total resistance of the potentiometer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we connect the two fixed contacts to a voltage source and measure\nthe output between the movable contact and one fixed contact, we get a\nvariable voltage divider:\\\n\n{width=\"521\" height=\"143\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the output is:\\\n\n{width=\"352\" height=\"48\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect a 10k\u2126. It will have three short wires sticking out in a\ntriangular pattern. The center terminal is the slider contact and the\ntwo outer terminals are the fixed contacts.\\\n\n{width=\"377\" height=\"196\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\no \nNote: Figuring out the value of a pot can be tricky. Some pots are\nlabeled directly with the value (e.g. \"100\" or \"10K\"). Others are\nlabeled using the same code as for fixed resistors, except that numbers,\nrather than colors, are used. For example, a 10k\u2126 resistor would have\nthe bands brown-black-orange. The values of these colors are 1, 0, and\n3, so a 10k\u2126 pot would have the label \"103\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWire the following circuit:\\\n\n{width=\"366\" height=\"121\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the function generator to produce a 2 V p-p 100-Hz sine wave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the potentiometer adjustment screw to midscale and \nmeasure\nv~out~.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pot has a scale divided into 10 equal divisions, presumably\nrepresenting 10 equal divisions of resistance. Set the pot to each of\nthese 10 divisions and measure v~out~. \nIs this presumption correct?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart D: Thevenin Equivalent Circuit of a Microphone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that the Thevenin theory states that any DC circuit can be\nmodeled as a power source and resistance. If a known resistive load is\nattached to a 'blackbox' circuit, such as an unknown power supply, the\nThevenin equivalence can be found for this blackbox circuit. \nHow do\nyou find the Thevenin equivalent circuit?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother advantage of knowing the Thevenin equivalence of a blackbox\ncircuit is that we can determine a load resistance that maximizes the\npower transfer to the load. \nWhat should the load resistance be for\nmaximum power transfer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\no Note: Thevenin theory not only applies to power supplies and function\ngenerators, but also to sensors. When sensors detect signals and provide\nsome outputs, they can be considered as sources with dependent voltage\nor current supplies.\n\n\no Recall that a speaker produces sound by converting current flowing\nthrough the voice coil into mechanical motion of the speaker cone. By\nreversing this process, it is also possible to use a speaker as a\nmicrophone. Sound waves will cause the speaker cone and voice coil to\nmove. As the voice coil moves through the permanent magnet, a current is\ninduced in the voice coil and a voltage appears across the voice coil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo speakers will be used here as a pair. One of them is the speaker,\nconverting the sine wave generated from function generator to sound. The\nother plays the role of a microphone, and reverses the sound to\nelectrical waves. They are connected as below.\\\n\n{width=\"273\" height=\"273\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the two wires connected to the microphone (the upper speaker) can\nbe considered as the two terminals of the load resistance. The whole\nsystem consisting of the function generator, the speaker and the\nmicrophone should be seen as a circuit with a sine wave power supply\n(Thevenin voltage) and an internal resistance (Thevenin resistance).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the \nFGEN\n to generate a sinusoid within audible range and connect\nthe upper speaker (microphone) to the oscilloscope. \nMeasure the\npeak-to-peak amplitude, which will be the Thevenin voltage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect different resistances between 1 and 10 ohms to the output of\nthe microphone and measure the load voltage V~L~ of these resistances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the Thevenin resistance of the system for each load and\nthe power transferred to each load resistance. What is the average\nThevenin resistance and is there any significant variation between\nmeasurements?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraw the power vs. resistance diagram\n and find the maximum point.",

            "text": "Recall that the Thevenin theory states that any DC circuit can be\nmodeled as a power source and resistance. If a known resistive load is\nattached to a 'blackbox' circuit, such as an unknown power supply, the\nThevenin equivalence can be found for this blackbox circuit.  How do\nyou find the Thevenin equivalent circuit?    Another advantage of knowing the Thevenin equivalence of a blackbox\ncircuit is that we can determine a load resistance that maximizes the\npower transfer to the load.  What should the load resistance be for\nmaximum power transfer?    o Note: Thevenin theory not only applies to power supplies and function\ngenerators, but also to sensors. When sensors detect signals and provide\nsome outputs, they can be considered as sources with dependent voltage\nor current supplies.  o Recall that a speaker produces sound by converting current flowing\nthrough the voice coil into mechanical motion of the speaker cone. By\nreversing this process, it is also possible to use a speaker as a\nmicrophone. Sound waves will cause the speaker cone and voice coil to\nmove. As the voice coil moves through the permanent magnet, a current is\ninduced in the voice coil and a voltage appears across the voice coil.    Two speakers will be used here as a pair. One of them is the speaker,\nconverting the sine wave generated from function generator to sound. The\nother plays the role of a microphone, and reverses the sound to\nelectrical waves. They are connected as below.\\ {width=\"273\" height=\"273\"}    Now the two wires connected to the microphone (the upper speaker) can\nbe considered as the two terminals of the load resistance. The whole\nsystem consisting of the function generator, the speaker and the\nmicrophone should be seen as a circuit with a sine wave power supply\n(Thevenin voltage) and an internal resistance (Thevenin resistance).    Set the  FGEN  to generate a sinusoid within audible range and connect\nthe upper speaker (microphone) to the oscilloscope.  Measure the\npeak-to-peak amplitude, which will be the Thevenin voltage.    Connect different resistances between 1 and 10 ohms to the output of\nthe microphone and measure the load voltage V~L~ of these resistances.    Calculate the Thevenin resistance of the system for each load and\nthe power transferred to each load resistance. What is the average\nThevenin resistance and is there any significant variation between\nmeasurements?    Draw the power vs. resistance diagram  and find the maximum point.",

            "text": "ELEC 240 Lab\n\n\n\n\nPrelude\n\n\nOrganizing Your Breadboard\n\n\nThe first three Labs have been something of a \"warmup\" in terms of\nutilizing the breadboard. We've used only one or two of the interface\ncomponents at a time and we've built circuits consisting of 2 or 3\ncomponents which we've disassembled at the end of lab. With this Lab we\nwill begin constructing more complicated circuits having more external\nconnections. Since some of these will perform functions we will need in\nother Labs, we will want to leave them in place on the breadboard for\nfuture use. To keep this from degenerating into chaos, we need a plan\nfor organizing the layout and wiring on the breadboard and interface\nboard.\n\n\nThere are several aspects to this organization ranging from small\ndetails to the big picture.\n\n\nColor Coding\n\n\nThere are different colored wires available to use. You could just pick\npieces of wire at random, or you could try to use the different colors\nto designate different signals. There aren't enough colors for each\nsignal to have its own, but you can use different colors to denote\ndifferent classes of signals.\n\n\nOne set of signals you should color code are power and ground. In\nparticular, you should have a different color for +15\u00a0V, -15\u00a0V, and\nground and you should not use any of these colors for other signals. It\nwould be nice to use \"standard\" colors for these, but unfortunately\nthere are several competing standards. One color that nearly everyone\nagrees on is that red should be the positive power supply voltage. Most\nautomotive and electronic wiring uses black to denote ground. Electronic\nwiring which uses black for ground often uses blue for the negative\nsupply. However, our power supply and breadboard use green to denote\nground (the convention used in house wiring) and use black to denote the\nnegative supply.\n\n\nSo we have two possible \"standard\" color codes for power: (1) red\u00a0=\u00a0+,\ngreen\u00a0=\u00a0gnd, black\u00a0=\u00a0-, and (2) red\u00a0=\u00a0+, black\u00a0=\u00a0gnd, blue\u00a0 =\u00a0-. You\ncould use either of these, or make up your own. The pictures in this lab\nuse set (1).\n\n\nAnother useful thing to color code would be the wires or \"probes\" from\nthe interface board connector. That way you can tell which wire is \nCH1\n\nof the scope or which is the function generator output without having to\ntrace from one end of the wire to the other.\n\n\nPower Bussing\n\n\nEach of the power bus strips has three rows of contacts, so we can\ndistribute ground, +15\u00a0V, and -15\u00a0V throughout the entire breadboard\narea. Remembering to connect the two halves of each row together, we get\nthe following layout for power:\n\n\n{width=\"595\"\nheight=\"299\"}\n\n\nInterface Board Connector Assignments\n\n\nSome of the connectors on the Interface Board are dedicated to a single\nfunction (e.g. the telephone handset or the sound card). Others (e.g.\nthe BNC and phone jacks) are more flexible and may be connected to a\nvariety of signal sources or destinations. It will be helpful to\nestablish standard assignments for these connectors as well.\n\n\nIn the instructions and photographs, we will be using the following\nassignment:\n\n\n\n\nConnector\n\n  \nSocket Pin\n\n  \nSignal\n\n\nJ1-1\n  1\n  Oscilloscope channel 1\n\n\nJ1-2\n  2\n  Oscilloscope channel 2\n\n\nJ1-3\n  3\n  Function generator output\n\n\nJ1-6\n  8\n  Microphone\n\n\n\n\nOverall Layout\n\n\nWhen building a fairly complex circuit like you will in Lab 10,\ninvolving at least 4 op-amps and a dozen or so resistors and capacitors,\ngood engineering practice is to break down a complex system into a\nnumber of simple subsystems, each of which performs a single,\nwell-defined function.\n\n\nIn the unlikely event that your circuit does not work perfectly the\nfirst time you turn it on, it will make it easier for you (and your\nlabbie) to debug it if each of these subcircuits is laid out (neatly, of\ncourse) on its own little patch of breadboard and is connected to the\nother subcircuits in such a way that it may be easilly disconnected from\nthem for testing in isolation.\n\n\nOne of the circuits we will build this week, the microphone amplifier\nand mixer, will be used in most of our subsequent labs. You should put\nit in a location which will will not get in the way of building other\ncircuits, but will be convenient for connecting to the interface board\nand these other circuits.

There aren't enough colors for each\nsignal to have its own, but you can use different colors to denote\ndifferent classes of signals.  One set of signals you should color code are power and ground. In\nparticular, you should have a different color for +15\u00a0V, -15\u00a0V, and\nground and you should not use any of these colors for other signals. It\nwould be nice to use \"standard\" colors for these, but unfortunately\nthere are several competing standards. One color that nearly everyone\nagrees on is that red should be the positive power supply voltage. Most\nautomotive and electronic wiring uses black to denote ground. Electronic\nwiring which uses black for ground often uses blue for the negative\nsupply. However, our power supply and breadboard use green to denote\nground (the convention used in house wiring) and use black to denote the\nnegative supply.  So we have two possible \"standard\" color codes for power: (1) red\u00a0=\u00a0+,\ngreen\u00a0=\u00a0gnd, black\u00a0=\u00a0-, and (2) red\u00a0=\u00a0+, black\u00a0=\u00a0gnd, blue\u00a0 =\u00a0-. You\ncould use either of these, or make up your own. The pictures in this lab\nuse set (1).  Another useful thing to color code would be the wires or \"probes\" from\nthe interface board connector. That way you can tell which wire is  CH1 \nof the scope or which is the function generator output without having to\ntrace from one end of the wire to the other.",

To make up this\ndiscrepancy, we need to amplify the signal levels produced by the input\ntransducers.\n\n\nPart A: Photodiode Amplifier\n\n\nThe inverting op-amp circuit works by taking the current that flows into\nthe \"virtual ground\" at the inverting input and forcing it to flow in\nthe feedback resistor. Since the voltage across R~F~ is equal to\nR~F~I~F~, the output voltage (on the other terminal of R~F~ is\nproportional to the current flowing into the virtual ground. What if\ninstead of this current originating from the voltage across R~1~, it\ninstead came directly from a current source? Well, the output voltage\nwould still be proportional to it: \nv\n~out~=-R~F~I~F~=-R~F~I~in~, i.e.,\nwe have an amplifier which accepts a current as an input and produces a\nvoltage as an output. This is called a \ntransresistance amplifier\n.\n(Since a resistance converts its current to a voltage (v=R*i), a\ntransresistance converts a current in one part of the circuit to a\nvoltage in another.)\n\n\nIn Lab 2 we measured the \nvoltage\n across the photodiode and found some\nfairly distorted waveforms. It turns out that the \ncurrent\n produced by\na photodiode is proportional to the intensity of the light falling on\nit, while the voltage is proportional to the \nlogarithm\n of the\nintensity, hence the distortion. If we could produce an output signal\nproportional to the photodiode current, we would have a much better\ntransducer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWire the following circuit. (You can modify the previous circuit by\nremoving the 10 k\u2126 resistor and replacing it with the photodiode\n(connected to ground rather than to the function generator)).\\\n\n{width=\"306\" height=\"177\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you did in Lab 2, note the output voltage, v~out~, and observe how\nit changes as you cover and uncover the photodiode with your hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the function generator to produce an 8 V p-p, 100 Hz triangle\nwave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisconnect the BNC patch cord from the function generator output and\nconnect the BNC clip leads. Connect your red LED to the clip leads (like\nyou did with the photodiode in Exp. 2.3 Part B).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHold the LED directly above the photodiode and observe v~out~. \nIs it\nless distorted than in Lab 2?\n Switch the function generator to sine\nwave and observe the waveshape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch the function generator to square wave and increase the\namplitude to maximum. Slowly separate the LED from the photodiode,\nadjusting the alignment to maintain the best signal (just like Lab 2).\nWhat is the maximum distance you can get with this configuration and\nstill get a recognizable square wave signal? \nHow does it compare with\nwhat you got in Lab 2?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove the BNC clip leads, reduce the amplitude of the function\ngenerator, and reconnect the BNC patch cord. Unplug the photodiode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyze the transresistance amplifier using the op-amp design rules\nand show that v~out~ does equal ?R~F~i~d~.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B: Microphone Amplifier\n\n\nThe microphone we used in Lab 2 is called a \ndynamic\n microphone. The\nmicrophone that is housed in a telephone handset is called a\n\ncarbon-button\n (or \ncarbon\n for short) microphone. The output of the\ncarbon microphone is close to our standard 1 V level, but for the\ndynamic microphone to be useful, we will need to amplify its output. If\nwe don't mind the change of sign (which we don't for this application),\nwe have just the circuit we need.\n\n\nWe will use this circuit in several subsequent labs, so build it in a\nconvenient part of the breadboard (see discussion in \"Organizing your\nBreadboard\" above) and leave it assembled when lab is over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook back in your lab notebook to find the value you measured for the\noutput voltage of the dynamic microphone. \nCalculate the gain G\n\nrequired to amplify this to a 1 V p-p signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the value of R~1~\n that will give the circuit below a\ngain of G:\\\n\n{width=\"314\" height=\"177\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWire the above circuit by modifying your circuit from Part A, and\nconnect v~in~ to J1-6-left (Pin 8 on the Interface Board socket strip).\nPlug the dynamic microphone into J1-6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak into the microphone and observe v~out~. Does it have the\namplitude you expected? If not, adjust R~1~ until v~out~ is\napproximately 1 V p-p when speaking in a normal voice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C: Mixer\n\n\nWe want to be able to use both the dynamic microphone and the carbon\nmicrophone. We could build separate amplifiers for each and switch back\nand forth, but it would be more convenient to be able to use either one\n(or both) with no changes to the circuit.\n\n\nSince Kirchhoff's Current Law must hold true at the negative\ninput/virtual ground, if more than one current source is connected to\nit, the output voltage must be proportional to the sum of the currents.\nConsider the following circuit:\\\n\n{width=\"311\" height=\"173\"}\\\n- \nShow in your report that the output is a weighted sum of its\ninputs\n, in other words:\\\n\n{width=\"173\" height=\"30\"}\n\n\nWe can use this circuit as a \nmixer\n to amplify both the dynamic\nmicrophone output and the carbon microphone output by the appropriate\namount, and then combine them into a single signal.\n\n\n\n\nFirst construct the carbon microphone interface.\n\n\n\n\no Note: the carbon microphone is a resistive, or passive transducer.\nThis means that it doesn't convert acoustical energy to electrical\nenergy directly, but instead the acoustical energy varies some\nelectrical parameter (i.e., resistance). In order to interpret this\nchange in resistance, the transducer needs to be powered by an external\nsource which then produces a voltage output corresponding to the change\nin resistance. We do this by powering the carbon microphone with a\nvoltage source in series with a large resistor (i.e., creating a voltage\ndivider circuit).\n\n\no The following circuit should do nicely. Wire this circuit to the right\nof your dynamic microphone amplifier, and we will connect the two in a\ncouple of steps. (The carbon microphone is pins 12 and 13 on the\ninterface connector. There is a ground on pin 14).\\\n\n{width=\"301\" height=\"160\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlug the handset into J1-7. Speak into the handset microphone and\nverify that the above circuit works. Speak in the same normal voice you\nused for the dynamic microphone and \nmeasure the peak-to-peak amplitude\nof the signal\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to get rid of the pesky DC offset in the carbon microphone\noutput. On the scope we can do this by switching to the AC position. Or\ninstead, we can put a capacitor in series with the input. Putting it all\ntogether gives us the following circuit:\\\n\n{width=\"537\" height=\"192\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute the value of R~2~\n required to give an output of 1V p-p.\nPut together your two subcircuits and create the above circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak into each microphone and verify that v~out~ is about 1 V p-p in\neach case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the op-amp can drive a 100\u2126 resistance to more than our standard\nvoltage level, and since the handset earpiece resistance is greater than\n100\u2126, we should be able to drive it from the op-amp output. Connect one\nside of the earpiece (Pin 11 on the interface board) to ground (Pin 14).\nConnect the other side (Pin 10) to v~out~. Have your lab partner speak\ninto the dynamic microphone while you hold the handset to your ear and\nspeak into its microphone. Verify that both voices are audible\nsimultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not dissemble this circuit. We will use it in subsequent labs.",

The first type of op amp circuit is a\nsquare-wave generator, or also called an RC relaxation oscillator. We do\nthis by operating the op amp as a comparator. A comparator's output\ntoggles between +Vcc and -Vcc at a frequency dependent on the\ncharge/discharge rate of a capacitor through a feedback resistor. When\nthe output is high the capacitor charges. Once the voltage across the\ncapacitor reaches a certain positive reference voltage, the output is\ndriven negative. Once the capacitor charges to the negative reference\nvoltage, the output is driven high. With positive feedback, this cycle\ncontinues and we see a square wave oscillation on the output. The\nfrequency of the oscillation is $f = \\frac{1}{2*RC}$. Next we will\ncreate an integrator, which performs the mathematical operation of\nintegration with respect to time. How could we use an integrator to\ncreate different waveform shapes for our function generator? The\nintegrator works by passing a current that charges or discharges a\ncapacitor in the negative feedback loop. To analyze an integrator, first\nassume that the opamp is ideal. The integrator looks like as below,\n\n{width=\"399\" height=\"225\"}\nand uses the ideal constraints below.\n$i_f + i_s = 0$ $v_n = v_p$\nWe can define the currents as\n$i_s = \\frac{v_s}{R_s}$ $i_f = {C_f}\\frac{dv_o}{dt}$\nwith substitution into the first ideal constraint equation\n$\\frac{dv_o}{dt} = - {\\frac{1}{{R_s}C_f}}{v_s}$\nand multiplying both sides by $dt$ and integrate:\n$v_o = - {\\frac{1}{{R_s}C_f}}\\int_{t_o}\\^t {v_s}dt +\nv_o(t_o)$\nThe equation states that the output voltage of an integrator equals the\ninitial value of the voltage plus an inverted, scaled, replica of the\nintegral of the input voltage. If the initial voltage is zero, then the\noutput reduces to:\n$v_o = - {\\frac{1}{{R_s}C_f}}\\int_{t_o}\\^t {v_s}dt$\nFinally we will amplify our output with an inverting amplifier like we\nbuilt last time.",

You've probably\nalso noticed the button marked ```ATT -20dB``` on the function\ngenerator, so decibels don't just have to do with sound. So what exactly\nis a decibel? It's a logarithmic way of expressing the ratio of two\npower levels (or sound pressure levels, or voltage levels, or any other\nkinds of levels). More precisely, ${\\rm power\\: ratio\\: in\\: dB} =\n10 \\log\\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_0}\\right)$ where $P_0$ and $P_1$\nare the two powers being compared, and $\\log()$ is the common, or\nbase 10 logarithm. If we have two *voltage* levels, $V_1$ and\n$V_2$ across the same load resistance, $R_L$, then $10\n\\log\\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_0}\\right) = 10\n\\log\\left(\\frac{{V_1}\\^2/R_L}{{V_2}\\^2/R_L}\\right) = 20\n\\log\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_0}\\right).$ Why logarithmic? The smallest\nperceivable sound level corresponds to an acoustic power density of\napproximately $10\\^{-12}\\~\\text{W}/\\text{m}\\^2$. But the level at\nwhich the sensation of sound begins to give way to the sensation of pain\nis about $1\\~\\text{W}/\\text{m}\\^2$. To cope with this large dynamic\nrange without loosing track of the number of zeros after the decimal\npoint, a logarithmic scale is useful. It's important to remember that a\ndecibel measurement expresses a *ratio*. So it always makes sense to\nsay that a signal $x$'s amplitude is so many dB greater (or less) than\nsignal $y$'s amplitude. But if we say that a signal is *equal* to\nsome number of decibels, then there must be a reference level. For\nsound, that reference level is usually taken as\n$10\\^{-12}\\~\\text{W}/\\text{m}\\^2$ which corresponds to a pressure of\n$10\\^{-5}\\text{N}/\\text{m}\\^2$. If we call this the reference\npressure level, $p_0$, we get the definition of *sound pressure\nlevel* ${\\textrm SPL} = 20 \\log\\left(\\frac{p}{p_0}\\right)$\n(where we use 20 instead of 10 since power is proportional to the square\nof the pressure). In a circuit, the choice of a reference level is not\nquite so obvious. For voltages, the typical choice is 1\u00a0V, which gives\n\"decibels relative to 1\u00a0Volt\" or dBV for short. Other forms you may\nencounter are dBW (relative to 1\u00a0watt) or dBm (relative to 1\u00a0mW). It is\nsometimes stated that the response of a filter falls off at \"20dB per\ndecade\" or \"6dB per octave\". This is just another way of saying that the\nresponse varies as 1/f. In other words, if $f_2$ is 10 times $f_1$\n(i.e. the frequencies are separated by one decade) then $\\vert\nH(f_2)\\vert$ will be 1/10 of $\\vert H(f_2)\\vert$.

By definition it\nconsists of a single component at the fundamental frequency whose\namplitude is equal to the amplitude of the waveform. Nevertheless, it is\nuseful being able to see the amplitude and frequency in a single\npicture, as well as being able to assess how \"pure\" (i.e. how truly\nsinusoidal) the purported sine wave actually is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the cable from the DAQ card to J3-1 on the rightmost interface\nmodule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the output of the function generator to CH1 of the scope and\nto A/D input 4 (pin 46 on the bottom interface board socket connector).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the function generator to produce 2 V p-p, 500 Hz sine wave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the \nspectrum analyzer\n\nand open in Labview. Set \"number of samples per channel\" and \"rate\" to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet \"averaging mode\" to RMS averaging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the instrument by selecting Run from the Operate menu, or by\npressing the run button (the small arrow just below the menu bar). The\ninstrument is divided into a display area (the large black area on the\nleft with green lines and text) and a control area (the gray area on the\nright). For now, let's concentrate on the display area. It should look\nsomething like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n{width=\"624\" height=\"445\"}\n\n\n\n\nThe top portion is the waveform display. It should be showing a sine\nwave, just like the scope. Vary the function generator amplitude control\nand verify that these values change appropriately.\n\n\n\n\no There is some additional information about the signal just above the\nwaveform display. The line labeled 'Signal Amplitude' gives three\ndifferent measurements of the signal amplitude. Vrms: the RMS voltage;\ndBV: the RMS voltage in decibels relative to 1V; Vp-p: the peak-to-peak\nvoltage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisconnect the function generator. What remains is a \nnoise\n signal\nwhich is being generated within the rest of the system. In this case it\nhas both a \nrandom\n component (the grass) and a periodic component (the\n3.3 kHz signal).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReconnect the function generator. \nVary the frequency and observe how\nthe spectrum display changes\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B: The Spectrum of Triangle and Square Waves\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fourier series of a triangle wave has only odd harmonics, which\nfall off as 1/n^2^ (12 dB/octave). Set the function generator to produce\na triangle wave and see if this is the case. \nAre there any even\nharmonics? If so, why are they there? What happens when you vary the\nduty cycle?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe square wave also consists only of odd harmonics, but falling off\nas 1/n (6 dB/octave). Set the function generator to square wave and\nobserve the spectrum. Vary duty cycle. Depending on the exact frequency\nyou may see a number of extraneous harmonics. These are due to the\nphenomenon of \naliasing\n which we will examine later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spectrum analyzer labeled \"Spectrum\" displays magnitude and\nfrequency on a linear scale. It is sometimes useful to view the spectrum\non a semi-log or log-log plot. Stop executing the program, right-click\non the spectrum display (gray area) and click on Properties-\nScales.\nSelect Log. Adjust the amplitude if necessary to obtain a good display.\nNote the hyperbolic shape of the 1/n fall off in magnitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow get a log-log plot with magnitude in dB by changing the Y-scale to\nLog and setting a multiplier of 20 (under Scale Factors). Note that the\n1/f fall off is now a \"linear\" 20 dB/decade slope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch the function generator to triangle wave. \nIs the slope now 40\ndB/decade, as we expect?\n Set the spectrum analyzer back to linear\ndisplay (both magnitude and frequency). Note the shape of the spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the function generator to square wave. Set the Duty Cycle to 15%.\nYou should now have a waveform consisting of narrow pulses. Note the\nshape of the spectrum. It should have the sin(x)/x (sinc) shape you saw\nin ELEC241.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the spectrum analyzer back to dB magnitude and log frequency. Set\nthe duty cycle to 50%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C: The Spectrum and Frequency Response\n\n\n\n\nWire the following circuit:\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{width=\"208\" height=\"143\"}\n\n\n\\\nThis is the same circuit we used in Lab 3, so you should have its\ntransfer function in your lab notebook.****\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect the output of the function generator to v~in~. Also connect\nCH1 of the scope and A/D input 4 to v~in~.****\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet the function generator to produce a 50 Hz sine wave at 1 Vrms (0\ndBV).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove CH1 of the scope and A/D input 4 to v~out~.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncrease the frequency of the function generator and observe the\nbehavior of the spectrum display. The tip of the peak corresponding to\nthe fundamental of the sine wave will trace out the magnitude of the\ntransfer function of our circuit. Note the two numbers above the\nspectrum display. They give the magnitude and frequency of the largest\npeak in the spectrum. The \"Peak Frequency\" readout should correspond to\nthe frequency setting of the function generator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the transfer function falls off as 1/f for high frequencies, we\nexpect the output to fall 6 dB per octave for frequencies well above the\ncutoff frequency. \nCheck the response at 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz and\nsee how well this holds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn off the function generator.",

By definition it\nconsists of a single component at the fundamental frequency whose\namplitude is equal to the amplitude of the waveform. Nevertheless, it is\nuseful being able to see the amplitude and frequency in a single\npicture, as well as being able to assess how \"pure\" (i.e. how truly\nsinusoidal) the purported sine wave actually is.    Connect the cable from the DAQ card to J3-1 on the rightmost interface\nmodule.    Connect the output of the function generator to CH1 of the scope and\nto A/D input 4 (pin 46 on the bottom interface board socket connector).    Set the function generator to produce 2 V p-p, 500 Hz sine wave.    Download the  spectrum analyzer \nand open in Labview. Set \"number of samples per channel\" and \"rate\" to    Set \"averaging mode\" to RMS averaging.    Start the instrument by selecting Run from the Operate menu, or by\npressing the run button (the small arrow just below the menu bar). The\ninstrument is divided into a display area (the large black area on the\nleft with green lines and text) and a control area (the gray area on the\nright). For now, let's concentrate on the display area. It should look\nsomething like this:    \\ {width=\"624\" height=\"445\"}   The top portion is the waveform display. It should be showing a sine\nwave, just like the scope. Vary the function generator amplitude control\nand verify that these values change appropriately.   o There is some additional information about the signal just above the\nwaveform display. The line labeled 'Signal Amplitude' gives three\ndifferent measurements of the signal amplitude. Vrms: the RMS voltage;\ndBV: the RMS voltage in decibels relative to 1V; Vp-p: the peak-to-peak\nvoltage.    Disconnect the function generator. What remains is a  noise  signal\nwhich is being generated within the rest of the system. In this case it\nhas both a  random  component (the grass) and a periodic component (the\n3.3 kHz signal).

The square wave also consists only of odd harmonics, but falling off\nas 1/n (6 dB/octave). Set the function generator to square wave and\nobserve the spectrum. Vary duty cycle.

To see the actual underlying waveform more clearly, switch the display\nto connected lines: Place the cursor on the box marked \"display style\"\nunderneath the display and select the continuous line style from the\n\"Common Plots\" submenu.    Restart the program and continue increasing the frequency of the\nfunction generator until you reach 5 kHz, stopping at several points\nalong the way to examine the waveform. When the function generator\nfrequency is exactly half the sampling frequency the samples will\nalternate the same positive and negative values. (This may be easier to\nsee by switching to the vertical line plot display style.)    Continue increasing the function generator frequency. Notice that as\nyou approach 10 kHz, you begin to see a well-defined sine wave which decreases  in frequency as you increase the function generator\nfrequency. This is the  alias  of the generator frequency. At exactly 10\nkHz you should get a zero frequency sine wave.    Continue increasing the function generator frequency past 10 kHz. Note\nthat you once again have a sine wave that increases in frequency as the\ninput frequency increases.    Explain the concept of aliasing, folding, and the Nyquist criterion,\nand relate to your results.    Try square and triangle waves of various frequencies and see what\nhappens to them as the frequency changes. ****    Press the STOP button and exit the waveform view program.  \\\n\\",

Try: ```matlab out1 = .25 * sig1;\nsound(out1, Fs) ``` Or if you're lazy: ```matlab sound(.25 *\nsig1) ``` We can also make the signal bigger: ```matlab sound(4 *\nsig1) ``` About the simplest thing we can do to *two* signals is to\nadd them together: ```matlab out2 = sig1 + sig2; ``` Listen to\n```out2``` and look at its spectrogram. **Can you identify the\ntwo different signals in both the audible and visual domains?** Both\nthe A/D converter which digitized the input signal and the D/A converter\nwhich converts the processed samples back to an analog signal have\nlimited range of values that they can represent. By keeping our input\nsignal below 5 V we keep it within the range of the A/D converter and\navoid \"clipping\" the signal. However, when we add two signals together\nor send then through systems having a gain greater than one, we may\ncreate an output signal with values too large for the D/A converter to\nconvert. If this happens you will hear distortion in the output signal.\nTo avoid this, you can use the ```soundsc()``` command instead of\n```sound()```. This command automatically scales the signal value\nso that it fits within the range of the D/A converter. Another\ninteresting thing we can do is *multiply* the two signals together.\nDigitally, this is just as easy to do as adding them, but this is very\ndifficult to do in an analog circuit. ```matlab out3 = sig1 .* sig2;\n``` Note the special MATLAB construct ```.*``` denoting point\nby point multiplication, as opposed to matrix multiplication. Listen to\n```out3``` and look at its spectrogram. Can you identify either of\nthe two signals in either the aural or visual domains? ### Part B:\nSimple Filtering As you saw in ELEC241, filter a digital signal involves\nforming a weighted sum of the past input and output samples:\n\n\n$a_oy(n) = \\sum_{k=1}\\^{M} a_ky(n-k) + \\sum_{k=1}\\^{N}\nb_kx(n-k)$\n\n\nMatlab has a function for performing this operation: ```matlab y =\nfilter(b, a, x); ``` Choosing the values of the $a_k$'s and\n$b_k$'s is the art of *filter design,* which we'll look at in the\nnext part. For now, we'll just try a few simple values for *a* and\n*b*. As a tip, record the characteristics of each filter we look at -\nyou will be asked to summarize each type at the end of experiment 9.4. A\n*finite impulse response* (FIR) or non-recursive filter has all the\n$a_k$ (except $a_0$) equal to zero, i.e. it is a weighted sum of\ninput samples. The simplest FIR filter is the *boxcar* filter in which\nall the $b_k$ are equal to 1. Define a length 5 boxcar filter:\n```matlab a=1; b=[1 1 1 1 1]; ``` Matlab has a function to\ncompute and display the frequency response of a filter: ```matlab\nfreqz(b, a) ``` Note that the frequency axis is labeled in terms of\nthe Nyquist frequency, which is the sampling rate. So for our sampling\nrate, 1 corresponds to 5 kHz. Although it is a little distorted because\nof the logarithmic scaling, this is a close relative of our old friend\n$sin(x)/x$. Also note that the jumps in phase are caused by a change\nin sign of the transfer function (the magnitude is always positive).\nTaking this into account, the phase is a *linear* function of\nfrequency. We can also look at the *unit-sample response* of the\nfilter: ```matlab delta = [1 zeros(1,100)]; y = filter(b, a,\ndelta); plot(y, '.') ``` As you would expect, the unit-sample\nresponse is a rectangular pulse, which supposedly looks like the side\nview of a boxcar. Now let's try applying this filter to our signal:\n```matlab out1 = filter(b, a, sig1); ``` Listen to\n```out1``` and look at its spectrogram. ```matlab sound(out1,\nFs); specgram(out1, 156, Fs) ``` As you can tell from its frequency\nresponse plot, this is a \"sort-of\" lowpass filter, though not a very\ngood one. **Can you tell this by comparing the sound and spectrogram\nof the output with the input? What do the blue areas of the spectrogram\ncorrespond to?** Repeat from the beginning of Part B using a length 10\nboxcar filter. **What is the relation between the length of the filter\nand its frequency response?** An *infinite impulse response* (IIR)\nfilter has an unit-sample response that doesn't go to zero after a\nfinite number of samples. IIR filters are usually implemented\n*recursively*, i.e. with non-zero $a$ coefficients. Define a first\norder recursive filter: ```matlab a=[1, -.9]; b=[1]; ``` Using\nthe same technique as above, look at its unit-sample and frequency\nresponse. Note that this is also a lowpass filter, with a more\nconventional frequency response than the boxcar filter. Apply this\nfilter to the input signal. Listen to the output and plot its\nspectrogram. **Can you tell by listening and looking that this is a\nlowpass filter?** An interesting thing happens if we change the sign\nof $a_1$: ```matlab a = [1 .9]; ``` Look at the unit-sample\nand frequency response of this filter. Apply it to the input signal,\nlisten to the output, and plot its spectrogram. **What kind of filter\nis this?** ### Part C: Fancy Filtering To get filters that are\nreally effective (i.e. that pass the desired frequencies with minimum\ndistortion and reject undesired frequencies as strongly as possible), we\nneed to have a design procedure to find the optimum set of coefficients\nfor a given specification. If you take ELEC 431, you will learn how to\ndo this. In the meantime, we will utilize pre-constructed algorithms.\nThe *Butterworth* filter is one of the classic filter designs. It is\ncharacterized by having the \"flattest\" possible passband. Unfortunately,\nits performance in the stop band is decidedly mediocre. Design a\n$5\\^{th}$-order lowpass Butterworth filter having a cutoff frequency\nof 600 Hz with our 10 kHz sampling frequency and print out their\ncoefficients: ```matlab [b,a] = butter(5, 600/5000); b a ```\nLook at the unit-sample response and the frequency response. Notice how\nmuch closer this is to an ideal low pass filter. Also notice the scale\non the y-axis. For a better comparison with previous plots, try changing\nthis scale: ```matlab subplot(2,1,1) axis([0 1 -60 0]) ``` Also\nnote that the phase is not linear. Now apply the filter to our input\nsignal and listen to the output: ```matlab out=filter(b,a,sig1);\nsound(out, Fs) ``` We can also design FIR filters that are\nsignificantly better than our boxcar filter: ```matlab a=1\nb=fir1(5,600/5000); ``` Examine the unit-sample and frequency\nresponse of this filter and apply it to the reference signal. FIR\nfilters really start to get interesting when we build very long ones.\nTry the same cutoff frequency with 50 coefficients: ```matlab\nb=fir1(50,600/5000); ``` Note that we now have a filter of order 50.\nHow would you like to design and build an analog (RLC) filter of this\norder?! **Look at the unit-sample and frequency response of this\nfilter. What function does the unit-sample response remind you of?**\nNote that this filter has a much more ideal shape than any of the\nothers. Finally apply this filter to the reference signal. **Can you\ntell the difference in the sound or the spectrogram between the effects\nof this filter and the length 5 filter?** You will need your signals\n```sig1``` and ```sig2``` for the next section.",

Apply it to the input signal,\nlisten to the output, and plot its spectrogram. **What kind of filter\nis this?** ### Part C: Fancy Filtering To get filters that are\nreally effective (i.e. that pass the desired frequencies with minimum\ndistortion and reject undesired frequencies as strongly as possible), we\nneed to have a design procedure to find the optimum set of coefficients\nfor a given specification. If you take ELEC 431, you will learn how to\ndo this. In the meantime, we will utilize pre-constructed algorithms.\nThe *Butterworth* filter is one of the classic filter designs. It is\ncharacterized by having the \"flattest\" possible passband. Unfortunately,\nits performance in the stop band is decidedly mediocre. Design a\n$5\\^{th}$-order lowpass Butterworth filter having a cutoff frequency\nof 600 Hz with our 10 kHz sampling frequency and print out their\ncoefficients: ```matlab [b,a] = butter(5, 600/5000); b a ```\nLook at the unit-sample response and the frequency response. Notice how\nmuch closer this is to an ideal low pass filter. Also notice the scale\non the y-axis. For a better comparison with previous plots, try changing\nthis scale: ```matlab subplot(2,1,1) axis([0 1 -60 0]) ``` Also\nnote that the phase is not linear. Now apply the filter to our input\nsignal and listen to the output: ```matlab out=filter(b,a,sig1);\nsound(out, Fs) ``` We can also design FIR filters that are\nsignificantly better than our boxcar filter: ```matlab a=1\nb=fir1(5,600/5000); ``` Examine the unit-sample and frequency\nresponse of this filter and apply it to the reference signal. FIR\nfilters really start to get interesting when we build very long ones.\nTry the same cutoff frequency with 50 coefficients: ```matlab\nb=fir1(50,600/5000); ``` Note that we now have a filter of order 50.\nHow would you like to design and build an analog (RLC) filter of this\norder?! **Look at the unit-sample and frequency response of this\nfilter. What function does the unit-sample response remind you of?**\nNote that this filter has a much more ideal shape than any of the\nothers. Finally apply this filter to the reference signal. **Can you\ntell the difference in the sound or the spectrogram between the effects\nof this filter and the length 5 filter?** You will need your signals\n```sig1``` and ```sig2``` for the next section.",

Note that this has the\neffect of reversing the shape of the filter since it moves its negative\nfrequencies (which are the mirror image of its positive frequencies) up\nto $\\frac{Fs}{2}$. In other words, we have reflected or *reversed*\nthe spectrum about the frequency $\\frac{Fs}{4}$ (2.5 kHz in this\ncase). Since this was accomplished by multiplying the time domain\nrepresentation of the signal by $(-1)\\^{n}$, we should be able to\nreverse the spectrum of a *signal* by multiplying it by the same\nsequence. This is indeed the case and the process is called\n(unimaginatively enough) *spectral reverse*. For reasons which you\nwill soon see, it has been used as a technique for *scrambling* speech\nto prevent eavesdroppers, wiretappers, and spies from being able to\nunderstand it. First we need our sequence $(-1)\\^{n}$: ```matlab\nflip = cos(pi*[1:40000]'); ``` **Note: Be sure to include the\nprime (') symbol.** Now we multiply our top secret message by the\nencoding sequence: ```matlab out1 = sig1 .* flip; ``` Look at the\nspectrogram of the output signal and verify that the spectrum of the\noriginal signal has indeed been flipped. Listen to the signal. Can you\nunderstand it? As a test of the security of the system, have a member of\nanother lab group listen to your reversed signal and try to understand\nit! So how do we unscramble the signal? Simple, since the reflection of\na reflection is the original, simply rereflect the scrambled signal.\n```matlab out2 = out1 .* flip; ``` Listen to the rereflected\nsignal and verify that it is unscrambled. **Draw a block diagram of\nthe scrambler system you have built. Show the spectrum of the signal at\neach point in the system.** ### Part B: Computer Music In the\nprevious Experiment we created discrete (single-frequency) tones, swept\ntones, and \"fuzzy\" tones. An artistic application for all these tones\nwould be to string them together to form tunes. Indeed, one of the very\nearly applications of the digital computer was in the production of\nmusic. Let's see if we can build up a simple tune. First we define the\ntempo to be 4/4 at 150 beats/minute: ```matlab quarter = [1:4000];\nhalf = [1:8000]; eighth = [1:2000]; ``` Now let's make a note:\n```matlab n1=sin(0.2463 * quarter); sound(n1,Fs) ``` Add a few\nmore notes to our collection: ```matlab n2=sin(0.2765 * quarter);\nn3=sin(0.3103 * quarter); ``` Now we can build up a phrase:\n```matlab phrase = [n1 n2 n3 n1]; ``` Add a repeat: ```matlab\ntune = [phrase phrase]; ``` Let's check how it sounds: ```matlab\nsound(tune, Fs) ``` Can you recognize our 'mystery tune' from this\nfragment? If you would like to try to complete this tune (or make up a\ntune of your own), here is a \ntable of note frequencies\n.\n### Part C: Making Better Notes Music made up of just a sequence of\nsine waves is pretty boring. The musical notes we've seen in previous\nlabs had more harmonics. Although they have a strong fundamental and few\nharmonics, whistled notes and notes from a flute are not pure tones.\nOther instruments (e.g. violins, trumpets, the voice) have an even\nricher set of harmonics. In each case this *harmonic structure* is one\nof the characteristics that gives the instrument its individual sound.\nAnother is the variation in amplitude of a note with time, called the\n*envelope*. A note from a piano begins abruptly when the hammer\nstrikes the string, then gradually decays away. A note from a trumpet\ncan begin very softly, build to a loud *forte*, and sustain until the\ntrumpeter runs out of breath. In some cases the harmonic structure as\nwell as the amplitude change with time. The various harmonics in a piano\nnote decay at different rates. In a bell, not only do the different\nfrequencies that make up the note decay at different rates, but they are\nnot harmonically related (and so are called *partials* rather than\nharmonics). Nevertheless, the ear *perceives* a pitch, based on\nrelationships between these partials. The ear can also perceive pitch\neven when no discrete frequencies are present (i.e. in a signal which is\n*random*). As an example of how the shape of the envelope shapes the\ncharacter of the note, let's make our fake flute into a fake piano by\nadding an envelope with a sharp attack and gradual decay: ```matlab\np1 = n1 .* (0.9995 .\\^ quarter); plot(p1) sound(p1,Fs) ``` Let's try\na complete tune with our new 'instrument': ```matlab p2 = n2 .*\n0.9995 .\\^ quarter p3 = n3 .* 0.9995 .\\^ quarter tune2 = [p1 p2 p3 p1\np1 p2 p3 p1]; sound(tune2,Fs) ``` **Plot the time function and the\nspectrogram of this tune. Can you identify the notes?** As mentioned\nabove, we can also create notes that are not periodic. First we need our\nFIR lowpass filter back: ```matlab b=fir1(50,200/5000); ``` Now we\nturn it into a bandpass filter centered about our desired note, put\nwhite noise into it, and get out narrowband noise which is our note:\n```matlab r1=filter(b.*cos([0:50]*0.2463*4),1,randn(size(n1)));\nsound(r1,Fs) ``` Add a few more notes to make a complete set, and we\ncan get another version of our tune: ```matlab\nr2=filter(b.*cos([0:50]*0.2764*4),1,randn(size(n1)));\nr3=filter(b.*cos([0:50]*0.3103*4),1,randn(size(n1))); tune3 = [r1\nr2 r3 r1 r1 r2 r3 r1]; sound(tune3, Fs) ``` Plot the time function\nof this tune: ```matlab plot(tune3) ``` **Can you find the\nindividual notes? Now plot the spectrogram. Can you find them now?**\nWe can make an \"orchestra\" by adding together the sounds of several\ninstruments: ```matlab sound(tune2+tune3, Fs) ``` However, as you\nprobably know, this tune is a *round*, i.e., it is intended to be\nadded to a time-shifted version of itself. To make this work, we will\nneed the entire tune. If you have not completed the tune yet, the notes\nare below. * Phrase1: G(.2463)/4, A(.2765)/4, B(.3103)/4, G(.2463)/4;\nRepeat. * Phrase2: B(.3103)/4, C(.3288)/4, D(.3690)/2; Repeat. *\nPhrase3: D(.3690)/8, E(.4142)/8, D(.3690)/8, C(.3288)/8 B(.3103)/4\nG(.2463)/4; Repeat. * Phrase4: G(.2463)/4, D(.1845)/4, G(.2463)/2;\nRepeat. The notation is name(frequency)/duration, i.e. G(.2463)/4 is a\nquarter note G with $\\frac{2{\\pi}f}{Fs}=.2463$, which is generated\nby ```G4 = sin(.2463 * quarter);``` * Giving the notes more\nmnemonic names (```G4``` for a G quarter note, ```D2``` for\na D half note, etc.) should make it easier to build the tune without\nmaking errors. * \"Repeat\" means to repeat all the notes from the\nbeginning of the phrase (once, not recursively). To play the tune as a\nround, we need to add the tune to a copy of itself shifted by the length\nof one phrase. Since Matlab doesn't like adding vectors of different\nlength, we will have to pad the beginning (or end) of each voice with\nzeros. ```matlab voice1=[Tune zeros(size(phrase1))];\nvoice2=[zeros(size(phrase1)) Tune]; soundsc(voice1+voice2, Fs); ```\nA more interesting effect can be obtained by having the different voices\nplayed by different \"instruments\". If you feel up to it, make another\nversion of the complete tune using one of the other sounds we've created\n(or if you don't like any of them, make up your own instrument). Then\nplay these two voices as a round as in the previous step.",
