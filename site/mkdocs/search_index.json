However when we insert a wire between any pair, we electrically connect all metal fingers together.\n\n\nTo make a breadboard, an array of these clips is embedded in\na plastic block which holds them in place and insulates\nthem from each other, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the size and arrangement of the clips, we get\neither a socket strip or a bus strip.\n\nThe socket strip is used for connecting components together.\nIt has two rows of short (5 contact) clips\narranged one above another, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bus strip is used to distribute power and ground voltages\nthrough the circuit.\nIt has has six long (24 contact) clips\narranged lengthwise, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the bus strip is not electrically connected in the center. If you want a single, continuous bus, you will have to bridge that central gap yourself.\n\n\nWhen we combine two socket strips, three bus strips,\npower connectors, power tie points, interface modules,\nand an interface connector on a large printed circuit board,\nwe get the complete breadboard:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In this picture we have replaced the plastic covers, hiding the\nconnection between the terminal points).\n\n\nThe breadboard lets us connect components together\nand by wiring the bus strips to the binding posts and the binding\nposts to the power supply, to connect the power supply to the\ncircuit.\nNow what we need is a way to bring\nconnections from the rest of the instruments into the breadboard.",

The first step is to figure out where pin 1 is. The remaining pins are in chronological order and increment in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\nIf pin 1 is in the lower left corner,\nthen the writing on the package reads left to right. Alternately, some ICs will have a dot above pin 1. A third indication is a semi-circle indentation on the top end of the chip - pin 1 will be to the left of it.\n\n\nTo simplify power wiring, we should run the positive bus above each socket strip and the negative bus below.\nDoing this and running ground on the remaining buses gives us\nthe following layout for power:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterface Board Connector Assignments.\n\n\n\nSome of the connectors on the Interface Board are dedicated to\na single function (e.g. the telephone handset or the sound card).\nOthers (e.g. the BNC and phone jacks) are more flexible and may\nbe connected to a variety of signal sources or destinations.\nIt will be helpful to establish standard assignments for these\nconnectors as well.\n\n\nIn the instructions and photographs, we will be using the\nfollowing assignment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnector\n\n\n\n\nSocket Pin\n\n\n\n\nSignal\n\n\n\n\n\nJ1-1\n\n\n1\n\n\nOscilloscope channel 1\n\n\n\n\nJ1-2\n\n\n2\n\n\nOscilloscope channel 2\n\n\n\n\nJ1-3\n\n\n3\n\n\nFunction generator output\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall Layout.\n\n\n\n\nThis\nfinal project\nwill be a fairly complex circuit.\nGood engineering practice is to break down a complex system\ninto a number of simple\nsubsystems, each of which performs a single,\nwell-defined function.\n\n\nIn the unlikely event that your circuit does not work perfectly\nthe first time you turn it on,\nit will make it easier for you (and your labbie) to debug it\nif each of these subcircuits is laid out (neatly, of course)\non its own little patch of breadboard\nand is connected to the other subcircuits in such a way\nthat it may be easilly disconnected from them for testing\nin isolation.\n\n\nOne additional advantage of a tidy layout with short wires is that\nit is more rugged.\nRemember that you will have to transport your circuit from your\nlab bench to the testing station without parts falling off or\nloops of wire getting caught and mysteriously pulled loose.\n\n\nReal World Circuit Problems\n\n\n\nOn paper all our components are ideal\nand no components exist where we don't draw them.\nIn an actual circuit, things are not\nquite so tidy:\nwires have non zero resistance and inductance,\nsources have output resistance,\nparasitic capacitances and mutual inductances exist between\nwires,\nand a host of other gremlins.\nIn addition, although we are only applying input signals\nup to a few 10s of kHz, the active devices\n(op amps and transistors) we use have gain\nat frequencies up to a few MHz (op amps) or 100s of MHz\n(transistors).\nThis means that all of the \nlittle\"\npieces of wire can become fairly effective antennas,\nradiating energy to\n(and receiving from) the rest of the world,\nand more significantly, to other parts of the circuit.\n\n\nWhat all this means is that a circuit which is wired correctly\ntopologically may fail to function as expected.\nAlthough we can't eliminate all of these effects, we can\ndo some things to minimize them. Here are a few.\n\nLayout.\n\nTry to arrange your layout so that each function is grouped together\nin a single area of the board\nand so that stages that are connected together are close to\neach other.\nThis will allow connections to be made with shorter wires.\nAlso try to avoid having high level signals near low level stages.\n\n\n\n\nTwisted Pairs.\n\nOne way to reduce unwanted coupling between\ndifferent signals in your circuit is to use\n\ntwisted pairs\n,\ni.e. a pair of wires twisted together with one wire connected\nto ground and the other carrying the signal.\n\n\nTo make a twisted pair,\nselect two wires having an aesthetically pleasing combination of colors\nand twist them together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could use twisted pair wires for connections between the\ninterface board and your circuit,\nas well as any other long runs of wire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse one wire for the signal and connect the other to ground,\nat both ends of the run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome signals (e.g. the photodiode input)\ndon't have a ground.\nIn this case, you can still use a twisted pair,\nbut neither wire will be grounded.\n\n\n\n\nRouting.\n\nTwisted pair or not, try to keep wires carrying high level signals\n(large voltages or currents)\n(e.g. the LED or earphone)\naway from those carrying\nlow level signals\n(e.g. the photodiode or dynamic microphone).\nA corollary to this is to keep outputs away from inputs,\nespecially in the same subcircuit.\nIt's better for wires to cross at right angles\nthan to run parallel to each other.\n\n\n\n\nBypass Capacitors.\n\nAnother path for unwanted coupling between stages is via the\npower supply.\nTo reduce this, use some of your electrolytic capacitors as\n\nbypass capacitors\n,\ni.e. connect them between the power supply voltages and ground\n(be sure to observe correct polarity on the electrolytic capacitors - the shorter wire is usually negative polarity, and you will also see a neg sign above this wire).\nIdeally each op amp should be bypassed, but you may be able\nto get by with a single pair of capacitors for the entire circuit.\n\n\n\n\nWiring Technique\n\n\n\nThe basic idea of wiring on a solderless breadboard is simple:\njust stick the ends of the component leads or wires into the holes.\nBut like any seemingly simple process, there are a few subtleties that can make the difference between success and failure.\n\n\nFirst a note of caution.\nThe material that the clips inside the breadboard are made of\n(so called \nnickel silver\") is a compromise between\ngood conductivity, corrosion resistance, and springiness.\nIn particular the elastic limit is considerably less than\nof a good steel spring\nand if spread too far, can be permanently distorted.\n\nTo avoid deforming the connector clips:\n\n\n\n \nUse only the wire that is supplied to you\n(24 gauge, solid telephone cable).\n\n \nUse only components with small diameter leads\n(1/4 watt resistors, capacitors, ICs, etc.).\n\n \nDo not\ninsert power resistor leads into the breadboard.\n\n \nWhen using power transistors in the breadboard,\nuse your pliers to twist each lead 90 degrees so that\nthey are gripped by the broad face rather than the narrow edge.\n\n \nNever insert more than one wire in a hole.\n\n\n\n\nWith the health of our breadboard assured, there\nare a few more things we can do to make sure that our connections\nare good ones.\n\n\n\n \nStrip about 7\nmm of insulation from each end of a piece of wire.\nLess than that raises the risk that insulation will be forced\nbetween the fingers of the clip.\nMore leaves bare wire exposed that can short to adjacent components. Don't try to jam the wires far down into the breadboard because it can scratch the bottom and damage the connection.\nOne exception: strip about 15\nmm from the end of a wire that\nwill be clamped in one of the binding posts. Make sure copper is\nshowing on both sides of the post when it is clamped down.\n\n \nWhen inserting a wire or component, use your needle nosed pliers\nrather than your fingers to hold it.\nGrip the wire or lead about 10\nmm from \nthe end and press straight down.\n\n \nIf the end of a wire becomes kinked, cut it off or\nuse your pliers to straighten it.",

            "text": "ELEC 240 Lab\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety\n\n\n\n\nFirst the bad news:\n\n\n\nElectricity can kill you.\n\n\n\nHow?\nThe two most common ways are:\n\n\n\n\n\n by cooking you (the hard way)\n\n by disrupting your nervous system (the easy way)\n\n\n\n\nThe good news is that\nin ELEC 240 laboratory, you will not be exposed to\ndangerous voltage levels\n\nunless\n\nyou mishandle the equipment.\nBefore we get close enough to the equipment to mishandle it,\nlet's take a closer look at just how you can get hurt if you do.\n\n\nWhat strength voltages and currents are harmful?\n\n\n\nElectricity is potentially the most dangerous commodity in general use\nby the public today.  In spite of this, less than 1 percent of the\n100,000 accidental deaths which occur annually in the United States\nare directly attributable to electrocution.  Considering the\never-increasing use of electricity in the home and industry, we should be alert to protect and better this\nexcellent safety record.\n\n\nAn understanding of the effects of electric shock, high-frequency\nheating, and other electrically produced physiological phenomena on the\nhuman body should be part of basic knowledge.\nWe present a brief survey of these topics in the hope that\nyou will become aware of the very real dangers inherent in the\napplication of electrical phenomena.  We shall consider these dangers\nin each frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum - from the power\nfrequencies to cosmic rays.\n\n\nPower Frequencies\n\n\n\n\n\nElectric Shock.\n\nThe ratio of fatalities to injuries for electric shock accidents is\nvery high in comparison to the corresponding figure for all other\naccidents.\n\nDeath due to electric shock is fast and permanent.\n\n\n\n\n\nShock Sensitivity.\n\nBecause of a person's highly developed nervous system,\nthey are sensitive to\nvery small currents.  For example, the tongue will give a sensation of\ntaste at currents as low as 45 microamperes.  The threshold of feeling\non the hand is found to be on the order of 5\nmA DC and 1\nmA at 60\nHz.\nThe shocks due to currents at this threshold are usually considered\nannoying rather than dangerous.  However, they are startling when not\nanticipated, and may cause involuntary movement that sometimes\nresults in serious injury.\n\nAs the value of current increases above the threshold, one becomes\naware of sensations of heat and contraction of the muscles.  Sensations\nof pain develop and voluntary control of the muscles in the path of\nthe current becomes increasingly difficult.  Finally a value of current\nis reached where the victim \"freezes\" to the circuit.  The value of\ncurrent at which a victim can just release the electrode is referred\nto as \"let-go\" current.  The average let-go current for healthy\npeople is about 16\nmA rms (60\nHz).\nIt is important to note that let-go\ncurrents of as low as 5\nmA have been measured.\nExperience has shown\nthat an individual can withstand, with no ill aftereffect except for\npossible sore muscles, repeated exposure to their let-go current for at\nleast the time required for them to release the conductor.\n\n\n\n\nEffect of Frequency and Waveform.\n\nGradually increasing direct current produces sensations of internal\nheating.  Sudden changes of current, however, produce powerful muscular\ncontractions, and interruption of the current causes very severe\nshocks.  Experiments at 10\nkHz indicate that the let-go current is\napproximately 3 times the 60\nHz value.  For non-sinusoidal\nwaveforms, the peak value seems to be the critical factor in muscular\nstimulation. \n\n\n\n\nNature of Bodily Damage.\n\nAs far as gross electrical effects are concerned, the body can be\nrepresented by the equivalent circuit shown in\nthe figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outer skin (epidermis) is roughly 0.1\nmm thick and has a resistance\nof the order of \\(10^5 \\Omega /{\\rm cm}^2\\) when dry.  The inner skin\n(dermis) and the internal organs are of relatively low resistance\nbecause of their high salinity.\nIt is generally believed that the\neffects of electric shock are due to the current flowing\nthrough the body.\n\nElectrical burns are a result of heating the skin.  The\nimmediate formation of blisters at the point of contact causes the\nskin to lose its protective resistance and more serious damage\nmay thus occur.\nBurns of this nature penetrate quite deeply and, while\nthey seldom become infected, heal very slowly.\n\nElectrical current is most dangerous when vital organs are in its path\nthrough the body.  Current may cause stoppage of breathing due to\nexcessive contraction of the chest muscles.  Temporary paralysis of\nrespiration may also occur if the current produces a block in the\nnervous system that prevents signals from reaching the lungs.  In\neither case, it is imperative that an approved form of artificial\nrespiration be applied immediately and continued without interruption\nuntil competent medical examination has been made.\n\n\n\n\nVentricular Fibrillation.\n\nPassage of electrical current through the heart is considered\nparticularly dangerous.  The heart exerts its pumping action as a\nresult of complex rhythmic motion controlled by periodic electrical\nimpulses to the muscle tissue.  The regularity of this motion assures\nproper blood circulation.  Electric current passing through the heart\ncompletely upsets this rhythmic motion and results in random muscular\ncontractions.  The heart no longer effectively pumps, but quivers like\nso much \"Jell-O\".  This condition is known as ventricular\nfibrillation and is nearly always fatal.\nEnergy of the impulse of current is responsible for this hazard and an\nestimate of the danger threshold for fibrillation is 13.5\nwatt-seconds.\n\n\nRadio Frequencies\n\nAt frequencies above the power range, the primary bodily damage results\nfrom dielectric heating.  Heating also occurs from both conduction\ncurrent and radiation. \n\nThe temperature of the human body is maintained remarkably constant by\nvery complex temperature regulating mechanisms.  These mechanisms,\ncoordinated by the brain, control temperature by regulating the\nproduction and loss of heat.  Circulation of bodily fluids contributes\nto the distribution of the heat.  The change in diameter of the blood\nvessels, for example, regulates the volume and velocity of flow.\nHowever, not all areas are equally well regulated, and it is possible\nfor local heating to occur.  Such local heating is apt to be\ndangerous, particularly if vital organs are involved.  A differential\nof \\(5^\\circ~\\text{C}\\)  maintained for a sufficient time may be injurious or\neven lethal.\nTestes, for example, undergo degenerate changes with\ntemperature rises as low as \\(1^\\circ~\\text{C}\\).\n\nThe amount of bodily temperature rise depends on the specific area\nexposed and its efficiency of heat elimination.  Other factors\ncontributing to temperature rise are intensity and the duration of\nexposure.  At frequencies below the microwave region \\((f \n<\n 1000~\\text{MHz})\\),\nabout 40 percent of the incident energy is absorbed.  These\nfrequencies cause deep (internal) heating and are very dangerous:\nsuch heating is not well indicated by sensory elements of the skin.  A\ntolerance figure of \\(0.001~{\\rm watt}/{\\rm cm}^2\\) for long-term exposures has been\nconsidered adequate.\nSurface burns resulting from R.F. currents are similar to those\nencountered at lower frequencies.\n\n\n\n\nMicrowave Frequencies\n\nThe effects of the lower microwave frequencies are similar to those of\nradio frequencies and a comparable tolerance figure for exposure\nshould not be exceeded. \nAs the frequency increases \\({(f>3000~\\text{MHz}})\\), the incident energy is\nabsorbed by the skin with an efficiency of 40 to 50 percent.\nThe effects of such radiation are much the same as is encountered with\ninfrared and sunlight.\n\nThe possibility of the formation of eye cataracts must be considered\nat microwave frequencies.  These cataracts result in impairment of\nvision or even blindness as a result of the formation of a white cloud\nin the normally transparent cornea of the eye.  Cataracts are thought\nto occur in a manner analogous to the formation of the \"white\" of an\negg upon heating.  Experiments with rabbits have indicated that\ncataracts have formed in 3 to 9 days following a single 15 minute\nexposure to a 100 watt source of 12\ncm waves at a distance of 5\ncm.\nWhile the exposure indicated here is probably extreme, care should be\ntaken when working with high-powered radar sets.\n\n\n\n\nInfrared, Visible Light and Ultraviolet Frequencies\n\nThe immediate effects of this band of frequencies are popularly known\nas sunburn.  The eye, however, is particularly susceptible to excess\nexposure at these frequencies.  Such exposure can easily occur when\nobserving an electric arc without protection.  This may result in\nhemorrhages of the choriod (the outer lining of the retina) and actual\ndestruction of portions of the retina itself.  In addition, actual\nimmediate pain may be encountered because of violent contractions\ninduced in the iris.  Photophthalmia (temporary snow blindness) is due\nto ultraviolet radiation following undue exposure to sunlight, an\nelectric arc, or a sun lamp.\n\n\n\n\nX-Rays and Nuclear Radiation\n\nThe effects of this portion of the electromagnetic spectrum of the\nhuman body are still being studied.  It has been found that the amount\nof energy absorbed by the tissue during exposure is the most important\nconsideration.  Damage to the reproductive organs has been found to be\nthe most sensitive indication of excessive exposure.\n\nControlled experiments with mice exposed to fast neutron radiation from\nan atomic reactor indicate the type of damage sustained by living animals.\nDuring the first 9 months of continuous exposure, no visible\ndifferences were noted.  The mice then began to lose weight and\ngradually lose hair.  Eye cataracts developed after a year and death\nfollowed.  Limited exposure to nuclear radiation resulted in a\nshortened life span.\n\nWe have yet to completely determine the consequences of the atomic\nbombs of World War II in terms of its biological effects.  For this\nreason, plus the fact that the latent period between exposure and\ndetection of damage may run into months and years, it behooves us to\ntake all precautions against X-Ray and nuclear radiation.",

Read \nSafety\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Using the DMM,\n    \n\n        measure the resistance of the light bulb. Does this correspond to the value you would expect from Ohm's Law given the values of voltage and current you\n        measured in Parts A and B?\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    o\n    \n\n        Caution: The DMM can only measure the resistance of an element when it is disconnected from the circuit. Remember to turn off the power source or the\n        value measured will be inaccurate.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \nPart D: Measuring the I-V Characteristics of the Light Bulb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    An ideal resistor obeys Ohm's law: I=V/R, i.e. the current through the element is proportional to the voltage across it. But for most real materials, the\n    resistance changes as the temperature changes, and clearly, the temperature of the light bulb's filament increases as more current flows through it. Let's\n    find out how the current and voltage of our light bulb are related.\n\n\n\n\n\n    For this measurement, we will need to vary the voltage applied to the bulb, so we will need a variable voltage source. This is provided by the DC Power\n    Supply on the VirtualBench. The DC power supply actually contains two variable voltage sources, but we will be using only one of them, the 0-6V supply.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Make sure the DC power dongle is attached to your VirtualBench (VB).\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Set the DMM to DC Volts. Connect the black (-) probe to the black 0-6V output terminal and the red (+) probe to the red terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Press the power button on the power supply interface below the oscilloscope screen. Gradually increase the output voltage by raising the voltage in the\n    +6V setting. Both the power supply and the DMM should show increasing voltage values. For several different values, note both the power supply +6V setting\n    and the DMM reading. \nHow do the two compare? \nReturn the voltage output to zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n    o\n    \n\n        Note: For the rest of this part, you will need to use VirtualBench as your second DMM. To use the DMM feature of VirtualBench, plug in the leads to the\n        digital multimeter feature of VirtualBench. Note that VirtualBench contains two pairs of sockets for the leads: the left socket pair can be used for\n        measuring voltage and resistance, while the right socket pair can be used for measuring current.\n        \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Wire the circuit below. You will need \nbanana plug patch cords\n for this.\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Measure the current for voltages between 0 V and 1 V, in steps of about 0.2 V. and between 1 V and 5 V in steps of about 0.5 V. It is not necessary to\n    have V exactly equal to 1.000, 1.500, etc. Just get it close and write down the numbers accurately.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - \nPlot I as a function of V. \nHow?\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - \nTo what point on this curve does the value of resistance you measured with the ohmmeter correspond?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Now generate a I vs. V curve for a 1000-ohm resistor (brown-black-red). You can use the NC and L binding posts to hold the resistor for this measurement.    \nIs our assumption that I=V/R for all V a valid one?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - When finished, turn off the DMM.",

A much more interesting class of signals are \ntime varying\n voltages and currents. For a slowly time varying signal, we could just write down the values as they change (as we did in plotting the light bulb I-V curve), but\n    for most time varying signals we need something a bit faster. On the VirtualBench, that would be the \noscilloscope\n.\n\n\n\n\n    In order to measure time varying signals, we need a source of time varying signals. The DC power supply on the VirtualBench is our source of constant voltages, and the \nfunction generator\n is our source for that class of time varying signals known as \nperiodic signals\n.\n\n\n\n\n    Part A: Viewing Signals with the Oscilloscope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    First get acquainted with the settings of the oscilloscope, even though you will continue using many of them in their default setting. Make sure you are being consistent in using either CH 1 or 2.\n\n\n\n\n    - Make sure the oscilloscope controls are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n    o Time/Div: 1ms\n\n\n\n\n    o Mode: Auto\n\n\n\n\n    o Display: CH 1\n\n\n\n\n    o Volts/Div: 2V\n\n\n\n\n    o AC-DC: DC\n\n\n\n\n    o Trigger: Edge; CH 1; Rising\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - If everything is in order, you should see a red horizontal line through the middle of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n    - Set up the function generator to produce a 1kHz sine wave (found to the right of the oscilloscope display). Turn on the power button for the function\n    generator. Set it as follows:\n\n\n\n\n    o Frequency: 1.0 kHz\n\n\n\n\n    o Amplitude 3 Vpp (Volts, peak-to-peak)\n\n\n\n\n    o DC Offset: 0 V\n\n\n\n\n    o Duty Cycle (only used for square wave setting)\n\n\n\n\n    o Function: Sine wave\n\n\n\n\n    - Connect the function generator's OUTPUT to the oscilloscope's CH 1 input. The easiest way to do this is to connect one end of a BNC patch cord to the\n    function generator FGEN and the other to the oscilloscope CH 1. This connects the generator's ground and signal terminals to the scope's ground and terminals. If all has gone well, you should see 6 full cycles of a sine wave in red.\n\n\n\n\n    - Now examine the effect of each control:\n\n\n\n\n    o Move the display with the positioning controls - click and drag the toolbar at the top.\n\n\n\n\n    o Change the Time/Div and Volts/Div settings to see what effects are produced.\n\n\n\n\n    o Click on the ruler in the bottom left of the screen and change the settings of the function generator to observe how the oscilloscope automatically\n    measures signal features such as frequency, period, and amplitude.\n\n\n\n\n    o \nWhy do you think these numbers are slightly different from the function generator settings?\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Examine the various waveforms produced by the function generator. Examine the effects of the DUTY CYCLE and DC OFFSET controls. Before going on, be certain that you are comfortable with the oscilloscope and function generator. If you are having problems, ask your labbie for help.\n\n\n\n\n    Part B: Quantitative Measurements with the Oscilloscope\n\n\n\n\n    In addition to allowing us to view the \"shape\" of a signal, the oscilloscope can also measure voltage, amplitude, time intervals, and frequency.\n\n\n\n\n- Connect the oscilloscope CH 2 input to the 0-6V output of the DC power supply. For this you can use a BNC patch cord and your \n    \nBNC to banana plug adapter\n.\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Switch to CH 2 and under Channel Settings, set the vertical offset to 0. This effectively sets the reference to 0, known as \"zeroing\" the signal.\n\n\n\n\n    - Increase the voltage to 2V. Continue to increase the voltage and see how well the scope readings and power supply settings agree.\n\n\n\n\n    - \nWhy would we want to use the oscilloscope to measure a \"DC\" voltage? \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Switch to CH 1 and \"zero\" Channel 1 as above. Set the function generator to produce a 2kHz sine wave. Set the TIME/DIV setting to 100 \ns. Measure the distance between two successive zero crossings of the same slope and multiply by the Time/Div factor to get the \nperiod\n of the waveform. Using the formula f=1/T, determine the measured frequency of the signal. \nHow does this compare with the nominal frequency? \n\n\n\n\n\n    o There are several ways we can express the amplitude of a signal. For the sine wave y(t)=Asin(2\nft) the amplitude A is equal to the distance from the positive (or negative) peaks of the waveform to the t-axis. This peak amplitude measurement is equally useful for any waveform which has equal positive and\n    negative peaks.\n\n\n\n\n    o Arbitrary waveforms may not have this property, so a more general measurement is the peak-to-peak amplitude, the distance between the positive and negative peaks of the signal.\n\n\n\n\n    o Other measures of a signal's magnitude include average and rms, which we'll talk about later. Since in general these different measures have different values, it is a good idea always to specify which amplitude measurement you are using.\n\n\n\n\n    - We can also use the oscilloscope to measure the \namplitude \nof a signal. Disconnect your oscilloscope from the function generator and use a BNC clip lead to connect CH 1 to the square wave and ground outputs of the scope, located to the right of the CH 2 input socket.\n\n\n\n\n    - \nSketch this signal's waveform.\n What is its period? What is its frequency? Adjust the CH 1 Volts/Div switch so that the waveform nearly\n    fills the screen vertically. Measure the peak-to-peak amplitude by counting the number of divisions between the upper and lower peaks and multiplying by the Volts/Div factor. Does your measurement of the waveform's amplitude correspond to the VB's measurement? (Click on the ruler button to look at the signal's measurements.)\n\n\n\n\n    - \nTake a screenshot of the waveform\n by going to File-\nExport Screenshot",

If it is too long, the exposed portion of the wire can short to other wires.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Plug one end of the wire to \npin1\n and the\n    other end to \npin 4\n. This will connect the\n    microphone to the scope (CH1). The grounds are automatically connected by the test board.\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Ensure the following settings on the oscilloscope:\n\n\n\n\n    o CH1\n\n\n\n\n\n    o Volts/Div : 5mV\n\n\n\n\n\n    o Time/Div: 1ms\n\n\n\n\n\n    o 1X setting on CH1\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Speak, sing, or whistle into the microphone and observe the signal on the scope. If the amplitude is too small, you can use the Volts/Div setting to get\n    a little more resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Experiment with the Time/Div settings to see what effect it has on the display.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Trigger: Drag the trigger icon (arrow followed by a T) just outside the signal display so that it crosses the signal.    \nWhat happens to the display?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    o What is Trigger? The oscilloscope has to continually refresh its display since a continuous signal is being fed to it. If each MISSINGDATAsweepMISSINGDATA (refresh of data)\n    started at a different place on the signal all we would get is a jumble of waveforms. The trigger sets an origin from which each sweep should start. That\n    way, particularly for periodic signals, the new waveform traces onto the old waveform and the signal appears static.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Measure the amplitude of the signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Produce a sustained vowel sound. \nWhich appears most sinusoidal?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Continue producing a sustained vowel sound and measure its frequency (by measuring the period).\n\n\n\n\n\n    - If you are musically inclined, sing or whistle the note \nA\n and measure its frequency. Otherwise search for the tone and play it on your phone. How does\n    your measured frequency compare with the \nofficial\n value for the frequency of \nA\n?\nIf there is a discrepancy, explain why it might be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Part B: The Lab PC as a Signal Source\n\n\n\n\n\n    The microphone is a device that converts an acoustic pressure into a voltage. The Lab PC contains a device, the Sound Card, that converts a sequence of\n    numbers into a voltage. This sequence of numbers could represent the \nsamples\n of a physical signal that you learned about in ELEC 241.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Since the computer can compute functions and the sound card can produce electrical output we could use the Lab PC as our 'function generator', which can produce more interesting functions than our VirtualBench \nFGEN\n can. Another advantage is that R\nout\n of the sound card is less than that of the function generator, so we can connect the speaker directly with less signal loss. Let's look at a few examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Plug the sound card cable from the Lab PC (with the \n8-pin round connector\n) into J2-1 on the\n    test board.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Connect a BNC clip lead to J1-3 and the clips to the loudspeaker.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Connect the speaker to the sound card speaker output but connecting a piece of wire between pins 3 and 20 on the test board.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - View the speaker output on CH1 (connect a wire from pin 20 to pin 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Listen to and observe the waveform for the following signals:\n\n\n\n\n\n    o \nSignal 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    o \nSignal 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    o \nMystery Signal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - We'll look at this signal again in a few weeks when we have some more sophisticated analysis tools. In the meantime, based on what you can hear and what you can see on the scope, \ncan you figure out the trick?\n\n\n\n    - Disconnect speaker and sound card cable.",

We will look at two: the photodiode, which converts light into an electrical signal, and the light emitting diode (LED) which converts electric\n    current to light.\n\n\n\n\n    Equipment\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotodiode\n\nRed LED\n\n\n\n\n    Part A: The Photodiode\n\n\n\n\n    - Connect the short lead (cathode) of the \nphotodiode\n to\n    ground and the long lead (anode) to CH1 of the scope. You can use the BNC clip leads for this, but the better way (which leaves your hands free) is to the\n    plug it into the breadboard and wire it to the appropriate interface pins (pin 1 to anode, pin 14 to cathode).\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n- View the DC signal on the scope.    \nNote the voltage produced by photodiode. How does it change when you cover the photodiode with your hand?\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Set CH1 to AC. What are the amplitude and frequency of the signal?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    o Hint: Click on the ruler by the bottom left corner of the oscilloscope view for helpful measurement tools.\n\n\n\n\n    - Explain the waveform you observed in the previous step. Switch back to DC.\n\n\n\n\n    Part B: Light Emitting Diode\n\n\n\n\n    - Using a 220-ohm (red-red-brown) resistor and your \nred LED\n, wire the following circuit:\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - First wire the resistor and LED on the breadboard. There are two ways to connect the power supply to the circuit (use one or the other MISSINGDATA not both):\n\n\n\n\n    o The first way: Plug your \nBNC-banana adapter\n into the 6V\n    power supply terminals. Note: There is a bump on one side of the adapter to denote which prong is connected to ground. Be sure to plug this prong into the\n    black terminal of the power supply.\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    Then use the clip leads to connect to the LED and resistor.\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    o The other way: Use the BNC adapter as above, but use a BNC patch cord to connect the power supply to J1-3. Use two pieces of wire to connect ground (pin\n    14) to the LED and J1-3 (pin 3) to the resistor.\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Turn on the power supply. Slowly increase the voltage until you see the LED just begin to glow. Measure the voltage across the LED. If the LED doesn't\n    light by the time the meter on the power supply reads 3 V, check your circuit to make sure the diode is wired in the correct orientation. Unlike a resistor\n    or light bulb, the LED is \npolarized.\n The anode must be positive for it to glow. Reverse the LED and verify that this is the case.\n\n\n\n\n    - Set the supply voltage to 3, 4, and 5 volts. At each step note the brightness of the LED and the voltage across it.\n\n\n\n\n    - Next power the LED with the FGEN instead of the power supply. Set it to produce a 100 Hz square wave with minimum amplitude.\n\n\n\n\n    - Increase the amplitude until it begins to glow. Is the glow steady?\n\n\n\n\n    - Slowly reduce the frequency of the FGEN. \nAt what frequency does noticeable flicker begin?\n\n\n\n\n\n    - \nHow does the number you measured in the previous step relate to the frame rate of television and motion pictures?\n\n\n\n\n\n    Part C: Optical Communication\n\n\n\n\n    - Now connect the photodiode to CH1 of the scope using a BNC-to clip leads cord.\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - With the LED still connected to the FGEN as in the previous part, set the frequency to 100 Hz.\n\n\n\n\n    - Hold the photodiode (pointing down) above the LED (pointing up). Adjust their relative positions to maximize the signal displayed on the scope.\n\n\n\n\n    o It may help to shield the components from ambient light with your hand.\n\n\n\n\n    - \nDescribe the waveform. Is it what you would expect?\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Set the FGEN to produce a triangle wave. Take a screenshot of the waveform. \nIs it what you expected?\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Reset the FGEN to produce a square wave. \nWhat is the maximum distance over which you can transmit a recognizable signal?\n\n\n\n\n\n    o Hint: Switch to AC signal with higher gain.\n\n\n\n\n- We have several of the components needed for building an optical communication system.    \nWhat components are missing?

To be useful its input or output (or both) should be connected to some other circuit. Unfortunately the interaction\n    between the circuit and a non-ideal source or load causes it to behave differently than it would in an idealized situation. With careful design, this\n    interaction can be minimized or accounted for. If ignored it can reduce the performance of the system, or keep it from working altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - A more accurate model of the system we measured would be:\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n- Based on your measurements,    \nwhat are the output resistance (R\nS\n) of the function generator and the input resistance (R\nL\n) of the scope?\n\n\n\n\n\n    Part C: The Potentiometer\n\n\n\n\n    - A potentiometer (pot for short) is a fixed value resistor with a third, movable contact or \nslider \nwhich may be positioned anywhere along the\n    resistive element. If we represent the position of the slider by \n, where \n varies between 0 (fully counterclockwise) and 1 (fully clockwise), then the\n    resistance between the lower end of the resistor and the slider will be \nR and between the slider and the upper end will be (1-\n)R, where R is the total\n    resistance of the potentiometer.\n\n\n\n\n    - If we connect the two fixed contacts to a voltage source and measure the output between the movable contact and one fixed contact, we get a variable\n    voltage divider:\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Then the output is:\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Select a 10k\n. It will have three short wires sticking out in a triangular pattern.

Some pots are labeled directly with the value (e.g. \"100\" or \"10K\"). Others are labeled using the\n        same code as for fixed resistors, except that numbers, rather than colors, are used. For example, a 10k\n resistor would have the bands\n        brown-black-orange. The values of these colors are 1, 0, and 3, so a 10k\n pot would have the label \"103\".\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Wire the following circuit:\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Set the function generator to produce a 2 V p-p 100-Hz sine wave.\n\n\n\n\n    - Set the potentiometer adjustment screw to midscale and \nmeasure v\nout\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - The pot has a scale divided into 10 equal divisions, presumably representing 10 equal divisions of resistance. Set the pot to each of these 10 divisions\n    and measure v\nout\n. \nIs this presumption correct?\n\n\n\n\n\n    Part D: Thevenin Equivalent Circuit of a Microphone\n\n\n\n\n    - Recall that the Thevenin theory states that any DC circuit can be modeled as a power source and resistance. If a known resistive load is attached to a\n'blackbox' circuit, such as an unknown power supply, the Thevenin equivalence can be found for this blackbox circuit.    \nHow do you find the Thevenin equivalent circuit?\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Another advantage of knowing the Thevenin equivalence of a blackbox circuit is that we can determine a load resistance that maximizes the power transfer\n    to the load. \nWhat should the load resistance be for maximum power transfer?\n\n\n\n\n\n    o Note: Thevenin theory not only applies to power supplies and function generators, but also to sensors. When sensors detect signals and provide some\n    outputs, they can be considered as sources with dependent voltage or current supplies.\n\n\n\n\n    o Recall that a speaker produces sound by converting current flowing through the voice coil into mechanical motion of the speaker cone. By reversing this\n    process, it is also possible to use a speaker as a microphone. Sound waves will cause the speaker cone and voice coil to move. As the voice coil moves\n    through the permanent magnet, a current is induced in the voice coil and a voltage appears across the voice coil.\n\n\n\n\n    - Two speakers will be used here as a pair. One of them is the speaker, converting the sine wave generated from function generator to sound. The other\n    plays the role of a microphone, and reverses the sound to electrical waves. They are connected as below.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Now the two wires connected to the microphone (the upper speaker) can be considered as the two terminals of the load resistance. The whole system\n    consisting of the function generator, the speaker and the microphone should be seen as a circuit with a sine wave power supply (Thevenin voltage) and an\n    internal resistance (Thevenin resistance).\n\n\n\n\n- Set the \nFGEN\n to generate a sinusoid within audible range and connect the upper speaker (microphone) to the oscilloscope.    \nMeasure the peak-to-peak amplitude, which will be the Thevenin voltage.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Connect different resistances between 1 and 10 ohms to the output of the microphone and measure the load voltage V\nL\n of these resistances.\n\n\n\n\n    -\n    \n\n        Calculate the Thevenin resistance of the system for each load and the power transferred to each load resistance. What is the average Thevenin\n        resistance and is there any significant variation between measurements?\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - \nDraw the power vs. resistance diagram\n and find the maximum point.",

An LTI circuit can alter the magnitude and phase of the input sinusoidal signal but not the actual frequency.\n\n \nMathematically, an expression can be created to describe this transfer function - it is the ratio of the load voltage (or output) to the source voltage (or input).\nWhen it comes time to measure the actual transfer\nfunction in the lab, things are a bit harder.\n\n\nOne obvious difficulty is that instead of simply making the\nmeasurement at a single frequency (e.g. zero),\nwe have to make it at\n\nall\n\nfrequencies,\na rather daunting task.\nFortunately, the function we expect to get is well behaved,\nso a few judiciously chosen frequencies should suffice.\n\n\nThe other problem is that we have to measure both the\nmagnitude and the phase of the input and output signals.\nWe already know how to measure magnitude.\nLet's see if we can figure out how to measure phase.\n\n\nWe will use the following technique:\n\n\n\n \nConnect the function generator to the input of the system\nbeing measured:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nConnect\n\nCH1\n\nof the scope to vin and \nCH2\n to vout.\n\n \nMake sure both CH 1 and 2 (red and yellow) are displaying on the oscilloscope.\n\n \nSet both channels to \nDC\n.\nIn a case where there is a DC offset on either the input or the output, set the corresponding switch to\n\nAC\n.\nIf you do so, be aware that this will influence the \nlow frequency portion of the measurement\n(below about 20\nHz).\n\n \nOverlay both traces on top of each other and set your display window such that 1-2 cycles of the sinusoids appear.\n\n \nSet the function generator frequency to the \nfirst frequency to be measured, say \n\\(f_1\\)\n.\nuntil the display looks similar to this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIn particular, you should have just over one cycle of the\ninput waveform displayed.  Pick a salient feature of the sinusoid (i.e., the max point, or upward x-axis crossing) measure the time delay between when they occur on the input and output sinusoids. Use the cursor feature of VirtualBench and click on the ruler for exact measurement values.\n\n\n\n\nLet's see what we've got:\n\n\n\n \nBy measuring the height of the peaks of\n\nCH1\n\nwe get \\(\\vert V_\\text{in}\\vert\\).\n\n \nSimilarly, the peaks of\n\nCH2\n\ngive \\(\\vert V_\\text{out}\\vert\\).\n\n \nCalculate \\(\\vert H(f_1)\\vert = \\frac{\\vert V_{out}\\vert}{\\vert V_{in}\\vert}\\).\n\n \nMeasure \\(t'\\), the distance between successive zero crossings of the\nsame slope.\nThis zero crossing corresponds to \\(\\sin(2\\pi f_1 t)=0\\) for \\(v_{in}\\) and \\(\\sin(2\\pi f_1 t' + \\phi)=0\\) for \\(v_{out}\\), where \\(\\phi = \\angle H(f_1)\\).\nSo we have \\(2\\pi f_1 t' + \\phi = 0\\) or \\(\\phi = -2\\pi f_1 t' = -2\\pi t'/T\\),\nwhere \\(T\\) is the period of the waveform.\nThis gives the phase in radians. To express the phase in degrees, we\nwould use:\n\\(\\angle H(f_1) = -360\\frac{t'}{T}\\)\n\n\n\n\nThis gives us the magnitude and angle of the transfer\nat a single frequency, \\(f_1\\).\nTo get the complete transfer function, we repeat the procedure at\ndifferent frequencies.",

This tells us how to find Pin 1: the dot is located next to\n    Pin 1 and the notch is located between Pins 1 and 8. The rest of the pins are numbered like this:\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    Pin 8 is not connected (NC). Pins 1 and 5 are used to eliminate the offset voltage. We won't be using this feature, so don't connect anything to these\n    pins. The remaining pins give us the following circuit symbol for our op-amp:\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n    For more information, see the \n741 data sheet\n.\n    \n\n    In order to function, the op-amp must be connected to an external \npower supply\n. Since we want to produce both positive and negative output\n    voltages, we need both positive and negative voltages for the power supply. These are labeled V\nCC+\n and V\nCC-\n on the diagram. For a\n    741, the nominal values are V\nCC+\n=15 V and V\nCC-\n=-15 V.\n\n\n\n\n\n    To avoid clutter, we won't show the power supply terminals (pins 4 and 7) on any of the subsequent circuit diagrams. However, they must be connected or\n    your amplifier will not operate.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Note that there is no ground terminal on the op-amp. The zero reference point is established by the external circuit and is not important to the op-amp\n    itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - If you have not already done so, wire the bus strips on your breadboard to provide positive power, negative power and ground buses. Whatever color scheme\n    you have chosen for your wires, you should use the green binding post for ground, the black for -15 V, and the red for +15 V.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Plug an op-amp into the breadboard so that it straddles the gap between the top and bottom sections of the socket strip. If you have wired the power\n    buses as suggested above, Pin 1 should be to the left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    o\n    \n\n        Warning: Do not try to unplug the op-amp with your thumb and forefinger. It's a good way to end up with the op-amp plugged into your fingertip. Use the\n        pliers or \nIC puller\n from your toolkit.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Connect Pin 4 (V\nCC-\n) to the negative power supply bus (-15 V). Connect Pin 7 (V\nCC+\n) to the positive power supply bus (+15 V).\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Set up the +/- 25V power supply dongle. Turn on the power supply and set the VirtualBench voltage control to 15 volts.\n\n\n\n\n    - Turn off the supply and connect the supply to the breadboard with banana plug patch cables. Connect the -25V terminal to the black binding post on your\n    breadboard, the+25V terminal to the red breadboard binding post, and the GROUND terminal to the green breadboard binding post. Note that none of the power\n    supply output terminals are connected to ground. If we want the power supply zero volt reference connected to ground, we must make the connection\n    ourselves.\n\n\n\n\n    Part B: Open-Loop Response\n\n\n\n\n- With the power turned off, wire the following circuit. Note that the input to the op amp is a 1000:1 voltage divider, so that a 1 V signal at v    \nin\n results in a 1 mV signal at the input of the op-amp.\n\n\n\n\n    o\n    \n\n        Caution: The components we've used so far have been simple (only two terminals) and fairly rugged (connecting a resistor or capacitor \"backwards\" won't\n        harm it). The op-amp has four times as many pins, so it's easier to make a mistake in wiring it. Unfortunately, it's also considerably more delicate,\n        so connecting it incorrectly can destroy it (often without so much as a puff of smoke to let you know that it has become an inoperational amplifier.\n        \n\n        Always wire your circuit with the power turned off and check your wiring carefully before turning the power on.\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Set the function generator to produce a 2 V p-p, 20 Hz sine wave.\n\n\n\n\n    - Connect the function generator output to v\nin\n of the circuit above. Connect CH1 of the scope to v\nin\n and CH2 to v\nout\n. Set\n    theCH2 VOLTS/DIV to 5. Make sure both channels of the scope are on DC.\n\n\n\n\n    - You should see a badly distorted (clipped) waveform at v\nout\n. If you don't, try increasing the function generator output.\n\n\n\n\n- Adjust the distorted waveform (will look like a square wave) so that it is symmetric about the x-axis.    \nNote the positive and negative peak values of v\nout\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Connect a 100\n resistor from v\nout\n to ground.\n What happens to the output signal?\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Remove the 100\n resistor from the op amp output.\n\n\n\n\n    - Set the FGEN to square wave.\n Now what is the shape of the v\nout\n waveform?\n Does the output change slope as fast as the input\n    does? This is called slew-rate limiting.\n\n\n\n\n    - Make sure the DC offset on the FGEN is zero. \nDoes the output also show zero DC offset?\n\n\n\n\n\n    o We have just seen a number of the shortcomings of a real (as opposed to an ideal) operational amplifier: clipping, which limits the maximum amplitude of\n    the output; slew-rate limiting, which limits the maximum slope of the output; and offset, which gives a non-zero output for zero input.\n\n\n\n\n    o When we reduce the overall gain with feedback, some of these (e.g. offset) are reduced significantly, and we get an output which is a faithful\n    reproduction of the input. However, other limits (such as maximum output level) must be respected for this fidelity to remain.\n\n\n\n\n    - \nSummarize why, if we want to amplify our signal with an op-amp, operating it in open loop is not the ideal solution.",

To make up this discrepancy, we need to amplify the signal levels produced by the input transducers.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Part A: Photodiode Amplifier\n\n\n\n\n\n    The inverting op-amp circuit works by taking the current that flows into the \"virtual ground\" at the inverting input and forcing it to flow in the feedback\n    resistor. Since the voltage across R\nF\n is equal to R\nF\nI\nF\n, the output voltage (on the other terminal of R\nF\n is\n    proportional to the current flowing into the virtual ground. What if instead of this current originating from the voltage across R\n1\n, it instead\ncame directly from a current source? Well, the output voltage would still be proportional to it: \nv\nout\n=-R\nF\nI\nF\n=-R\nF\nI\nin\n, i.e., we have an amplifier which accepts a current as an input and produces a voltage as an output. This is called a    \ntransresistance amplifier\n. (Since a resistance converts its current to a voltage (v=R*i), a transresistance converts a current in one part of the circuit to a voltage in another.)\n\n\n\n\n\n    In Lab 2 we measured the \nvoltage\n across the photodiode and found some fairly distorted waveforms. It turns out that the \ncurrent\n produced\n    by a photodiode is proportional to the intensity of the light falling on it, while the voltage is proportional to the \nlogarithm\n of the intensity,\n    hence the distortion. If we could produce an output signal proportional to the photodiode current, we would have a much better transducer.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Wire the following circuit. (You can modify the previous circuit by removing the 10 k\n resistor and replacing it with the photodiode (connected\n    to ground rather than to the function generator)).\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - As you did in Lab 2, note the output voltage, v\nout\n, and observe how it changes as you cover and uncover the photodiode with your hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Set the function generator to produce an 8 V p-p, 100 Hz triangle wave.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Disconnect the BNC patch cord from the function generator output and connect the BNC clip leads. Connect your red LED to the clip leads (like you did\n    with the photodiode in Exp. 2.3 Part B).\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Hold the LED directly above the photodiode and observe v\nout\n.\n Is it less distorted than in Lab 2?\n Switch the function\n    generator to sine wave and observe the waveshape.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Switch the function generator to square wave and increase the amplitude to maximum. Slowly separate the LED from the photodiode, adjusting the alignment\n    to maintain the best signal (just like Lab 2). What is the maximum distance you can get with this configuration and still get a recognizable square wave\n    signal? \nHow does it compare with what you got in Lab 2?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Remove the BNC clip leads, reduce the amplitude of the function generator, and reconnect the BNC patch cord. Unplug the photodiode.\n\n\n\n\n\n-    \nAnalyze the transresistance amplifier using the op-amp design rules and show that v\nout\n does equal ?R\nF\ni\nd\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Part B: Microphone Amplifier\n\n\n\n\n\nThe microphone we used in Lab 2 is called a \ndynamic\n microphone. The microphone that is housed in a telephone handset is called a    \ncarbon-button\n (or \ncarbon\n for short) microphone. The output of the carbon microphone is close to our standard 1 V level, but for the\n    dynamic microphone to be useful, we will need to amplify its output. If we don't mind the change of sign (which we don't for this application), we have\n    just the circuit we need.\n\n\n\n\n\n    We will use this circuit in several subsequent labs, so build it in a convenient part of the breadboard (see discussion in \"Organizing your Breadboard\"\n    above) and leave it assembled when lab is over.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Look back in your lab notebook to find the value you measured for the output voltage of the dynamic microphone. \nCalculate the gain G\n\n    required to amplify this to a 1 V p-p signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - \nCalculate the value of R\n1\n that will give the circuit below a gain of G:\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Wire the above circuit by modifying your circuit from Part A, and connect v\nin\n to J1-6-left (Pin 8 on the Interface Board socket strip). Plug\n    the dynamic microphone into J1-6.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Speak into the microphone and observe v\nout\n. Does it have the amplitude you expected? If not, adjust R\n1\n until v\nout\n is\n    approximately 1 V p-p when speaking in a normal voice.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Part C: Mixer\n\n\n\n\n\n    We want to be able to use both the dynamic microphone and the carbon microphone. We could build separate amplifiers for each and switch back and forth, but\n    it would be more convenient to be able to use either one (or both) with no changes to the circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Since Kirchhoff's Current Law must hold true at the negative input/virtual ground, if more than one current source is connected to it, the output voltage\n    must be proportional to the sum of the currents. Consider the following circuit:\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    - \nShow in your report that the output is a weighted sum of its inputs\n, in other words:\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    We can use this circuit as a \nmixer\n to amplify both the dynamic microphone output and the carbon microphone output by the appropriate amount, and\n    then combine them into a single signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - First construct the carbon microphone interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    o Note: the carbon microphone is a resistive, or passive transducer. This means that it doesn't convert acoustical energy to electrical energy directly,\n    but instead the acoustical energy varies some electrical parameter (i.e., resistance). In order to interpret this change in resistance, the transducer\n    needs to be powered by an external source which then produces a voltage output corresponding to the change in resistance. We do this by powering the carbon\n    microphone with a voltage source in series with a large resistor (i.e., creating a voltage divider circuit).\n\n\n\n\n    o The following circuit should do nicely. Wire this circuit to the right of your dynamic microphone amplifier, and we will connect the two in a couple of\n    steps. (The carbon microphone is pins 12 and 13 on the interface connector. There is a ground on pin 14).\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Plug the handset into J1-7. Speak into the handset microphone and verify that the above circuit works. Speak in the same normal voice you used for the\n    dynamic microphone and \nmeasure the peak-to-peak amplitude of the signal\n.\n\n\n\n\n    - We need to get rid of the pesky DC offset in the carbon microphone output. On the scope we can do this by switching to the AC position. Or instead, we\n    can put a capacitor in series with the input. Putting it all together gives us the following circuit:\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - \nCompute the value of R\n2\n required to give an output of 1V p-p. Put together your two subcircuits and create the above circuit.\n\n\n\n\n    - Speak into each microphone and verify that v\nout\n is about 1 V p-p in each case.\n\n\n\n\n    - Since the op-amp can drive a 100\n resistance to more than our standard voltage level, and since the handset earpiece resistance is greater than\n    100\n, we should be able to drive it from the op-amp output. Connect one side of the earpiece (Pin 11 on the interface board) to ground (Pin 14).\n    Connect the other side (Pin 10) to v\nout\n. Have your lab partner speak into the dynamic microphone while you hold the handset to your ear and\n    speak into its microphone. Verify that both voices are audible simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n    - Do not dissemble this circuit. We will use it in subsequent labs.",

By definition it consists of a single component at the fundamental frequency whose amplitude is equal\n    to the amplitude of the waveform. Nevertheless, it is useful being able to see the amplitude and frequency in a single picture, as well as being able to\n    assess how \"pure\" (i.e. how truly sinusoidal) the purported sine wave actually is.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Connect the cable from the DAQ card to J3-1 on the rightmost interface module.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Connect the output of the function generator to CH1 of the scope and to A/D input 4 (pin 46 on the bottom interface board socket connector).\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Set the function generator to produce 2 V p-p, 500 Hz sine wave.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Download the \nspectrum analyzer\n and open in Labview. Set \"number of samples per channel\" and \"rate\" to 10000. Set \"averaging mode\" to RMS averaging.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Start the instrument by selecting Run from the Operate menu, or by pressing the run button (the small arrow just below the menu bar). The instrument is\n    divided into a display area (the large black area on the left with green lines and text) and a control area (the gray area on the right). For now, let's\n    concentrate on the display area. It should look something like this:\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - The top portion is the waveform display. It should be showing a sine wave, just like the scope. Vary the function generator amplitude control and verify\n    that these values change appropriately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    o There is some additional information about the signal just above the waveform display. The line labeled 'Signal Amplitude' gives three different\n    measurements of the signal amplitude. Vrms: the RMS voltage; dBV: the RMS voltage in decibels relative to 1V; Vp-p: the peak-to-peak voltage.\n\n\n\n\n    - Disconnect the function generator. What remains is a \nnoise \nsignal which is being generated within the rest of the system. In this case it has\n    both a \nrandom\n component (the grass) and a periodic component (the 3.3 kHz signal).\n\n\n\n\n    - Reconnect the function generator. \nVary the frequency and observe how the spectrum display changes\n.\n\n\n\n\n    Part B: The Spectrum of Triangle and Square Waves\n\n\n\n\n    - The Fourier series of a triangle wave has only odd harmonics, which fall off as 1/n\n2\n (12 dB/octave). Set the function generator to produce a\ntriangle wave and see if this is the case.    \nAre there any even harmonics? If so, why are they there? What happens when you vary the duty cycle?\n\n\n\n\n\n    - The square wave also consists only of odd harmonics, but falling off as 1/n (6 dB/octave). Set the function generator to square wave and observe the\nspectrum. Vary duty cycle. Depending on the exact frequency you may see a number of extraneous harmonics. These are due to the phenomenon of    \naliasing\n which we will examine later.\n\n\n\n\n    - The spectrum analyzer labeled \"Spectrum\" displays magnitude and frequency on a linear scale. It is sometimes useful to view the spectrum on a semi-log or\n    log-log plot. Stop executing the program, right-click on the spectrum display (gray area) and click on Properties-\nScales. Select Log. Adjust the\n    amplitude if necessary to obtain a good display. Note the hyperbolic shape of the 1/n fall off in magnitude.\n\n\n\n\n    - Now get a log-log plot with magnitude in dB by changing the Y-scale to Log and setting a multiplier of 20 (under Scale Factors). Note that the 1/f fall\n    off is now a \"linear\" 20 dB/decade slope.\n\n\n\n\n    - Switch the function generator to triangle wave. \nIs the slope now 40 dB/decade, as we expect?\n Set the spectrum analyzer back to linear\n    display (both magnitude and frequency). Note the shape of the spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n    - Set the function generator to square wave. Set the Duty Cycle to 15%. You should now have a waveform consisting of narrow pulses. Note the shape of the\n    spectrum. It should have the sin(x)/x (sinc) shape you saw in ELEC241.\n\n\n\n\n    - Set the spectrum analyzer back to dB magnitude and log frequency. Set the duty cycle to 50%.\n\n\n\n\n    Part C: The Spectrum and Frequency Response\n\n\n\n\n    - Wire the following circuit:\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    This is the same circuit we used in Lab 3, so you should have its transfer function in your lab notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Connect the output of the function generator to v\nin\n. Also connect CH1 of the scope and A/D input 4 to v\nin\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Set the function generator to produce a 50 Hz sine wave at 1 Vrms (0 dBV).\n\n\n\n\n    - Move CH1 of the scope and A/D input 4 to v\nout\n.\n\n\n\n\n    - Increase the frequency of the function generator and observe the behavior of the spectrum display. The tip of the peak corresponding to the fundamental\n    of the sine wave will trace out the magnitude of the transfer function of our circuit. Note the two numbers above the spectrum display. They give the\n    magnitude and frequency of the largest peak in the spectrum. The \"Peak Frequency\" readout should correspond to the frequency setting of the function\n    generator.\n\n\n\n\n    - Since the transfer function falls off as 1/f for high frequencies, we expect the output to fall 6 dB per octave for frequencies well above the cutoff\n    frequency. \nCheck the response at 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz and see how well this holds.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Turn off the function generator.",

Note the form of the spectrum. It should consist of a series of peaks, like the signals from the\n    function generator, but unlike the function generator signals where the harmonics fall off monotonically, the amplitudes of the harmonics in a speech\n    signal rise and fall with increasing frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - To make it easier to study the spectrum, you can \"freeze\" the display by pressing the STOP button (continue producing the sound until the freezing is\n    complete). If you like, you can get a printout of the display by selecting \"Print Window\" from the File menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Estimate the fundamental frequency (pitch) of the waveform. Notice that unlike the function generator signals, the fundamental is not necessarily the\n    strongest component.\n    \n\n    It may be difficult to get an accurate estimate if the fundamental is low in frequency (e.g. a male voice). One way to improve accuracy is to find the\n    frequency of one of the higher harmonics and divide by its order.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - While trying to keep the same pitch, produce different sustained vowel sounds. Note how the \"envelope\" of the spectrum (the line connecting the tips of\n    the peaks) changes while the positions of the lines remains the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Now, produce the same sustained vowel sound (your choice) while varying the pitch. Notice how the overall shape of the spectrum remains the same as the\n    lines move up and down.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Play some music from a single musical instrument from your phone, into the microphone. Note the nature of the spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - A soft whistle should be very close to a pure tone. Whistle a tone of about 1 kHz into the microphone and see if this is the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Plug in the telephone handset. Verify that the carbon microphone input to the mixer still works by speaking into the handset microphone.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Whistle the same note into the handset microphone and observe the spectrum display. Does it have the same harmonic content as with the dynamic\nmicrophone? Since the acoustic signal was the same, the difference must be caused by distortion in the microphone.    \nWhich microphone has the least distortion? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Blow into the microphone and note the shape of the spectrum. This is a \nbroadband\n, random signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Produce an 'sh' sound. Note the shape of the spectrum. This is called an \nunvoiced fricative\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Now try a 'zh' sound (a \nvoiced fricative\n). How does its spectrum compare with the one in the previous step?\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Based on your observations of different speech sounds\n, can you determine an approximate bandwidth for speech?\n i.e. is there a frequency\n    below which \"most\" of the energy of the speech signals is concentrated?\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Part B: Analyzing an Unknown Signal\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Plug the sound card cable from the Lab PC into J2-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - We want to be able to hear the signal, so connect one side of the handset earpiece to the mixer output. Ground the other side of the handset earpiece.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - To play the sound card through our mixer, we will need to add a third input. To do this, add a 100-k\n resistor (R\n3\n)to the mixer\n    circuit so that it looks like this:\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Connect the sound card line out (pin 20 on the interface board socket strip) to v\nsound\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Unplug the dynamic microphone from J1-6. Unscrew the cover from the mouthpiece of the telephone handset, and remove the microphone cartridge. Now the\n    only input to the mixer is from the sound card.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Download and play the \nMystery Signal\n from Lab 2 (with\n    any Windows default player). You should be able to hear it through the earpiece and see it on the spectrum analyzer display.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - It may be easier to see what's going on if you set the spectrum analyzer display to linear magnitude and log frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Based on what you see on the spectrum display, can you explain how the mystery signal works? Hint: focus on a single peak and note how it changes from\n    one tone to the next.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Put the telephone handset back together.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Exit the spectrum analyzer program. Disconnect the DAQ cable from the interface board by using the ejector levers. Do not try to remove it by pulling on\n    the cable.",

The sequence of numbers\n    that results represents the original signal at these sample points, but ignores what goes on between them. If the signal is sufficiently well-behaved (i.e.\n    it satisfies the Nyquist criterion and contains no energy at frequencies greater than half the sampling frequency), then these sample points are enough to\nrepresent the original signal exactly. But if the original signal contains a frequency greater than half the sampling rate, that frequency will be    \naliased\n to a lower frequency.\n\n\n\n\n    Let's start by looking at what sampling looks like in the time domain.\n\n\n\n\n    - Connect the function generator output and CH1 of the scope to A/D input4 (pin 46 on the interface board socket strip).\n\n\n\n\n    - Set the function generator to produce a 5 V p-p, 300 Hz sine wave.\n\n\n\n\n- Download the \n spectrum analyzer\n and open in Labview. Set \"number of samples per\n    channel\" and \"rate\" to 10000. Set \"averaging mode\" to RMS averaging. Start the program by pressing the run button or by pressing CTRL-R with the cursor\n    over the window.\n\n\n\n\n    - Here's what we have:\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Right-click on the black box indicating waveform type above the Signal waveform, which says Dev1/ai4. Select Common Plots and select the 2nd option\n    (points only). You should see about three cycles of a sine wave displayed in the waveform graph. Unlike last week's display, the samples are shown as\n    individual dots, rather than connected line segments.\n\n\n\n\n    - Slowly increase the frequency to 2 kHz and note how the waveform becomes less clear.\n\n\n\n\n    - At 2 kHz, press STOP. You should see either several lines or several overlapping sine waves. This is an illusion caused by the fact that only a few\n    samples of each cycle are being taken.\n\n\n\n\n    - Make a sketch to illustrate what happens when the frequency of the waveform is equal to a small submultiple (1/5, in this case) of the sampling rate.\n\n\n\n\n    - To see the actual underlying waveform more clearly, switch the display to connected lines: Place the cursor on the box marked \"display style\" underneath\n    the display and select the continuous line style from the \"Common Plots\" submenu.\n\n\n\n\n    - Restart the program and continue increasing the frequency of the function generator until you reach 5 kHz, stopping at several points along the way to\n    examine the waveform. When the function generator frequency is exactly half the sampling frequency the samples will alternate the same positive and\n    negative values. (This may be easier to see by switching to the vertical line plot display style.)\n\n\n\n\n- Continue increasing the function generator frequency. Notice that as you approach 10 kHz, you begin to see a well-defined sine wave which    \ndecreases\n in frequency as you increase the function generator frequency. This is the \nalias \nof the generator frequency. At exactly 10 kHz\n    you should get a zero frequency sine wave.\n\n\n\n\n    - Continue increasing the function generator frequency past 10 kHz. Note that you once again have a sine wave that increases in frequency as the input\n    frequency increases.\n\n\n\n\n    - \nExplain the concept of aliasing, folding, and the Nyquist criterion, and relate to your results.\n\n\n\n\n\n    - Try square and triangle waves of various frequencies and see what happens to them as the frequency changes. \n\n\n\n\n\n    - Press the STOP button and exit the waveform view program.\n    \n\n        \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    Part B: Amplitude Quantization\n\n\n\n\n    Once the input signal has been sampled, it must be represented as a number in the computer. Since there are a limited number of bits available to encode\n    the number (12 in this case), there are only a limited number of values that can be exactly represented. Values in between two successive encodings must be\n    rounded or truncated to one or the other. This process of forcing the continuous input range into a discrete set of values is called \nquantization\n.\n\n\n\n\n    - On the left hand side of the spectrum analyzer are two controls which control the quantization of the sampled signal. The \nfull scale\n control\n    sets the maximum allowed bits of the signal. The number of bits control sets the \nnumber of bits\n that may be represented within the allowed range.\n\n\n\n\n    - Experiment with different values for \nfull scale\n and \nnumber of bits\n. What do you notice in the waveform display? What is the relation\n    between the number of levels and spectrum of the resulting signal?\n\n\n\n\n    - Stop and exit the spectrum analyzer program.",

Try:  \n\n\nout1 = .25 * sig1;\nsound(out1, Fs)\n\n\n\n\nOr if you're lazy:  \n\n\nsound(.25 * sig1)\n\n\n\n\nWe can also make the signal bigger:  \n\n\nsound(4 * sig1)\n\n\n\n\nAbout the simplest thing we can do to \ntwo\n signals is to add them together:  \n\n\nout2 = sig1 + sig2;\n\n\n\n\nListen to \nout2\n and look at its spectrogram. \nCan you identify the two different signals in both the audible and visual domains?\n  \n\n\nBoth the A/D converter which digitized the input signal and the D/A converter which converts the processed samples back to an analog signal have limited range of values that they can represent. By keeping our input signal below 5 V we keep it within the range of the A/D converter and avoid \"clipping\" the signal. However, when we add two signals together or send then through systems having a gain greater than one, we may create an output signal with values too large for the D/A converter to convert. If this happens you will hear distortion in the output signal. To avoid this, you can use the \nsoundsc()\n command instead of \nsound()\n. This command automatically scales the signal value so that it fits within the range of the D/A converter.  \n\n\nAnother interesting thing we can do is \nmultiply\n the two signals together. Digitally, this is just as easy to do as adding them, but this is very difficult to do in an analog circuit.  \n\n\nout3 = sig1 .* sig2;\n\n\n\n\nNote the special MATLAB construct \n.*\n denoting point by point multiplication, as opposed to matrix multiplication.  \n\n\nListen to \nout3\n and look at its spectrogram. Can you identify either of the two signals in either the aural or visual domains?  \n\n\nPart B: Simple Filtering\n\n\nAs you saw in ELEC241, filter a digital signal involves forming a weighted sum of the past input and output samples:\n\n\n\n\n\\(a_oy(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{M} a_ky(n-k) + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} b_kx(n-k)\\)\n\n\n  \n\n\nMatlab has a function for performing this operation:  \n\n\ny = filter(b, a, x);\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the values of the \n\\(a_k\\)\n's and \n\\(b_k\\)\n's is the art of \nfilter design,\n which we'll look at in the next part. For now, we'll just try a few simple values for \na\n and \nb\n.  As a tip, record the characteristics of each filter we look at - you will be asked to summarize each type at the end of experiment 9.4. A \nfinite impulse response\n (FIR) or non-recursive filter has all the \n\\(a_k\\)\n (except \n\\(a_0\\)\n) equal to zero, i.e. it is a weighted sum of input samples. The simplest FIR filter is the \nboxcar\n filter in which all the \n\\(b_k\\)\n are equal to 1. Define a length 5 boxcar filter:  \n\n\na=1;\nb=[1 1 1 1 1];\n\n\n\n\nMatlab has a function to compute and display the frequency response of a filter:  \n\n\nfreqz(b, a)\n\n\n\n\nNote that the frequency axis is labeled in terms of the Nyquist frequency, which is the sampling rate. So for our sampling rate, 1 corresponds to 5 kHz. Although it is a little distorted because of the logarithmic scaling, this is a close relative of our old friend \n\\(sin(x)/x\\)\n. Also note that the jumps in phase are caused by a change in sign of the transfer function (the magnitude is always positive). Taking this into account, the phase is a \nlinear\n function of frequency.  \n\n\nWe can also look at the \nunit-sample response\n of the filter:  \n\n\ndelta = [1 zeros(1,100)];\ny = filter(b, a, delta);\nplot(y, '.')\n\n\n\n\nAs you would expect, the unit-sample response is a rectangular pulse, which supposedly looks like the side view of a boxcar.  \n\n\nNow let's try applying this filter to our signal:  \n\n\nout1 = filter(b, a, sig1);  \n\n\n\n\nListen to \nout1\n and look at its spectrogram.  \n\n\nsound(out1, Fs);\nspecgram(out1, 156, Fs)\n\n\n\n\nAs you can tell from its frequency response plot, this is a \"sort-of\" lowpass filter, though not a very good one. \nCan you tell this by comparing the sound and spectrogram of the output with the input? What do the blue areas of the spectrogram correspond to?\n  \n\n\nRepeat from the beginning of Part B using a length 10 boxcar filter.  \n\n\nWhat is the relation between the length of the filter and its frequency response?\n  \n\n\nAn \ninfinite impulse response\n (IIR) filter has an unit-sample response that doesn't go to zero after a finite number of samples. IIR filters are usually implemented \nrecursively\n, i.e. with non-zero \n\\(a\\)\n coefficients.  \n\n\nDefine a first order recursive filter:  \n\n\na=[1, -.9];\nb=[1];\n\n\n\n\nUsing the same technique as above, look at its unit-sample and frequency response. Note that this is also a lowpass filter, with a more conventional frequency response than the boxcar filter. Apply this filter to the input signal. Listen to the output and plot its spectrogram. \nCan you tell by listening and looking that this is a lowpass filter?\n  \n\n\nAn interesting thing happens if we change the sign of \n\\(a_1\\)\n:  \n\n\na = [1 .9];\n\n\n\n\nLook at the unit-sample and frequency response of this filter. Apply it to the input signal, listen to the output, and plot its spectrogram. \nWhat kind of filter is this?\n  \n\n\nPart C: Fancy Filtering\n\n\nTo get filters that are really effective (i.e. that pass the desired frequencies with minimum distortion and reject undesired frequencies as strongly as possible), we need to have a design procedure to find the optimum set of coefficients for a given specification. If you take ELEC 431, you will learn how to do this. In the meantime, we will utilize pre-constructed algorithms.  \n\n\nThe \nButterworth\n filter is one of the classic filter designs. It is characterized by having the \"flattest\" possible passband. Unfortunately, its performance in the stop band is decidedly mediocre. Design a \n\\(5^{th}\\)\n-order lowpass Butterworth filter having a cutoff frequency of 600 Hz with our 10 kHz sampling frequency and print out their coefficients:  \n\n\n[b,a] = butter(5, 600/5000);\nb\na\n\n\n\n\nLook at the unit-sample response and the frequency response. Notice how much closer this is to an ideal low pass filter. Also notice the scale on the y-axis. For a better comparison with previous plots, try changing this scale:  \n\n\nsubplot(2,1,1)\naxis([0 1 -60 0])\n\n\n\n\nAlso note that the phase is not linear. Now apply the filter to our input signal and listen to the output:  \n\n\nout=filter(b,a,sig1);\nsound(out, Fs)\n\n\n\n\nWe can also design FIR filters that are significantly better than our boxcar filter:  \n\n\na=1\nb=fir1(5,600/5000);\n\n\n\n\nExamine the unit-sample and frequency response of this filter and apply it to the reference signal.  \n\n\nFIR filters really start to get interesting when we build very long ones.

What about long IIR filters? It turns out that if we let our transfer function have both a numerator and a denominator (i.e., both \n\\(a\\)\n and \n\\(b\\)\n coefficients) we can get filters of 'good' shape with a modest number of total coefficients. Filters of this form have been used in analog circuits (where filter order corresponds to the number of inductors and capacitors and op amps, and hence smaller is better) and the techniques for designing them carry over to digital filters. One of these is the Butterworth, which we've already seen. Another is the Elliptic or Cauer filter (so called because its design involves the use of the Jacobi elliptic function).  \n\n\nLet's design an \n\\(8^{th}\\)\n order Elliptic low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of \n\\(\\frac{Fs}{8}\\)\n:  \n\n\n[b,a] = ellip(8, 1, 60, 1000/5000);\nfreqz(b,a)\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument (8) is the filter order. The second argument (1) is the \npassband ripple\n, the amount (in dB) that we're willing to allow the actual value of the transfer function in the passband to deviate from the desired value (1, or 0 dB). The third argument (60) is the maximum value (in dB) that we're willing to allow the transfer function to have in the stopband. Subject to these constraints, the Elliptic design gives us the shortest possible \ntransition band\n, the region where the transfer function is changing from one to zero.  \n\n\nApply this filter to your reference signal, listen to the results, and look at the spectrogram. \nCan you see the difference between this filter and the 'equivalent' FIR filter (\n\\(b_0\\)\n)? Can you hear it?\n  \n\n\nWrite a summary of each of the different types of filter we've looked at (boxcar, first order IIR, Butterworth, fir1, elliptic). Consider such factors as the shape of the frequency response, phase characteristics, computational complexity, etc.\n  \n\n\nIs any one type of filter clearly the \"best\" (or the \"worst\")?

            "text": "So far, we've seen that long (in our case) FIR filters can be pretty good and that short filters of either type are pretty bad. What about long IIR filters? It turns out that if we let our transfer function have both a numerator and a denominator (i.e., both  \\(a\\)  and  \\(b\\)  coefficients) we can get filters of 'good' shape with a modest number of total coefficients. Filters of this form have been used in analog circuits (where filter order corresponds to the number of inductors and capacitors and op amps, and hence smaller is better) and the techniques for designing them carry over to digital filters. One of these is the Butterworth, which we've already seen. Another is the Elliptic or Cauer filter (so called because its design involves the use of the Jacobi elliptic function).    Let's design an  \\(8^{th}\\)  order Elliptic low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of  \\(\\frac{Fs}{8}\\) :    [b,a] = ellip(8, 1, 60, 1000/5000);\nfreqz(b,a)  The first argument (8) is the filter order. The second argument (1) is the  passband ripple , the amount (in dB) that we're willing to allow the actual value of the transfer function in the passband to deviate from the desired value (1, or 0 dB). The third argument (60) is the maximum value (in dB) that we're willing to allow the transfer function to have in the stopband. Subject to these constraints, the Elliptic design gives us the shortest possible  transition band , the region where the transfer function is changing from one to zero.    Apply this filter to your reference signal, listen to the results, and look at the spectrogram.  Can you see the difference between this filter and the 'equivalent' FIR filter ( \\(b_0\\) )? Can you hear it?     Write a summary of each of the different types of filter we've looked at (boxcar, first order IIR, Butterworth, fir1, elliptic). Consider such factors as the shape of the frequency response, phase characteristics, computational complexity, etc.     Is any one type of filter clearly the \"best\" (or the \"worst\")? If not, can you identify circumstances where a particular filter  would  be the best choice (or should  not  be chosen)?",

Note that this has the effect of reversing the shape of the filter since it moves its negative frequencies (which are the mirror image of its positive frequencies) up to \n\\(\\frac{Fs}{2}\\)\n. In other words, we have reflected or \nreversed\n the spectrum about the frequency \n\\(\\frac{Fs}{4}\\)\n (2.5 kHz in this case).  \n\n\nSince this was accomplished by multiplying the time domain representation of the signal by \n\\((-1)^{n}\\)\n, we should be able to reverse the spectrum of a \nsignal\n by multiplying it by the same sequence. This is indeed the case and the process is called (unimaginatively enough) \nspectral reverse\n. For reasons which you will soon see, it has been used as a technique for \nscrambling\n speech to prevent eavesdroppers, wiretappers, and spies from being able to understand it.  \n\n\nFirst we need our sequence \n\\((-1)^{n}\\)\n:  \n\n\nflip = cos(pi*[1:40000]'); \n\n\n\n\nNote: Be sure to include the prime (') symbol.\n  \n\n\nNow we multiply our top secret message by the encoding sequence:  \n\n\nout1 = sig1 .* flip;  \n\n\n\n\nLook at the spectrogram of the output signal and verify that the spectrum of the original signal has indeed been flipped.  \n\n\nListen to the signal. Can you understand it?  \n\n\nAs a test of the security of the system, have a member of another lab group listen to your reversed signal and try to understand it!  \n\n\nSo how do we unscramble the signal? Simple, since the reflection of a reflection is the original, simply rereflect the scrambled signal.  \n\n\nout2 = out1 .* flip;\n\n\n\n\nListen to the rereflected signal and verify that it is unscrambled.  \n\n\nDraw a block diagram of the scrambler system you have built. Show the spectrum of the signal at each point in the system.\n  \n\n\nPart B: Computer Music\n\n\nIn the previous Experiment we created discrete (single-frequency) tones, swept tones, and \"fuzzy\" tones. An artistic application for all these tones would be to string them together to form tunes. Indeed, one of the very early applications of the digital computer was in the production of music.  \n\n\nLet's see if we can build up a simple tune. First we define the tempo to be 4/4 at 150 beats/minute:  \n\n\nquarter = [1:4000];\nhalf = [1:8000];\neighth = [1:2000];\n\n\n\n\nNow let's make a note:  \n\n\nn1=sin(0.2463 * quarter);\nsound(n1,Fs)\n\n\n\n\nAdd a few more notes to our collection:  \n\n\nn2=sin(0.2765 * quarter);\nn3=sin(0.3103 * quarter);\n\n\n\n\nNow we can build up a phrase:  \n\n\nphrase = [n1 n2 n3 n1];\n\n\n\n\nAdd a repeat:  \n\n\ntune = [phrase phrase];\n\n\n\n\nLet's check how it sounds:  \n\n\nsound(tune, Fs)\n\n\n\n\nCan you recognize our 'mystery tune' from this fragment?  \n\n\nIf you would like to try to complete this tune (or make up a tune of your own), here is a \ntable of note frequencies\n.\n\n\nPart C: Making Better Notes\n\n\nMusic made up of just a sequence of sine waves is pretty boring. The musical notes we've seen in previous labs had more harmonics. Although they have a strong fundamental and few harmonics, whistled notes and notes from a flute are not pure tones. Other instruments (e.g. violins, trumpets, the voice) have an even richer set of harmonics. In each case this \nharmonic structure\n is one of the characteristics that gives the instrument its individual sound.  \n\n\nAnother is the variation in amplitude of a note with time, called the \nenvelope\n. A note from a piano begins abruptly when the hammer strikes the string, then gradually decays away. A note from a trumpet can begin very softly, build to a loud \nforte\n, and sustain until the trumpeter runs out of breath.  \n\n\nIn some cases the harmonic structure as well as the amplitude change with time. The various harmonics in a piano note decay at different rates. In a bell, not only do the different frequencies that make up the note decay at different rates, but they are not harmonically related (and so are called \npartials\n rather than harmonics). Nevertheless, the ear \nperceives\n a pitch, based on relationships between these partials.  \n\n\nThe ear can also perceive pitch even when no discrete frequencies are present (i.e. in a signal which is \nrandom\n).  \n\n\nAs an example of how the shape of the envelope shapes the character of the note, let's make our fake flute into a fake piano by adding an envelope with a sharp attack and gradual decay:  \n\n\np1 = n1 .* (0.9995 .^ quarter);\nplot(p1)\nsound(p1,Fs)\n\n\n\n\nLet's try a complete tune with our new 'instrument':  \n\n\np2 = n2 .* 0.9995 .^ quarter\np3 = n3 .* 0.9995 .^ quarter\ntune2 = [p1 p2 p3 p1 p1 p2 p3 p1];\nsound(tune2,Fs)\n\n\n\n\nPlot the time function and the spectrogram of this tune. Can you identify the notes?\n  \n\n\nAs mentioned above, we can also create notes that are not periodic. First we need our FIR lowpass filter back:  \n\n\nb=fir1(50,200/5000);\n\n\n\n\nNow we turn it into a bandpass filter centered about our desired note, put white noise into it, and get out narrowband noise which is our note:  \n\n\nr1=filter(b.*cos([0:50]*0.2463*4),1,randn(size(n1)));\nsound(r1,Fs)\n\n\n\n\nAdd a few more notes to make a complete set, and we can get another version of our tune:  \n\n\nr2=filter(b.*cos([0:50]*0.2764*4),1,randn(size(n1)));\nr3=filter(b.*cos([0:50]*0.3103*4),1,randn(size(n1)));\ntune3 = [r1 r2 r3 r1 r1 r2 r3 r1];\nsound(tune3, Fs)\n\n\n\n\nPlot the time function of this tune:  \n\n\nplot(tune3)\n\n\n\n\nCan you find the individual notes? Now plot the spectrogram. Can you find them now?\n  \n\n\nWe can make an \"orchestra\" by adding together the sounds of several instruments:  \n\n\nsound(tune2+tune3, Fs)\n\n\n\n\nHowever, as you probably know, this tune is a \nround\n, i.e., it is intended to be added to a time-shifted version of itself. To make this work, we will need the entire tune. If you have not completed the tune yet, the notes are below.  \n\n\n\n\nPhrase1: G(.2463)/4, A(.2765)/4, B(.3103)/4, G(.2463)/4; Repeat.\n\n\nPhrase2: B(.3103)/4, C(.3288)/4, D(.3690)/2; Repeat.\n\n\nPhrase3: D(.3690)/8, E(.4142)/8, D(.3690)/8, C(.3288)/8 B(.3103)/4 G(.2463)/4; Repeat.\n\n\nPhrase4: G(.2463)/4, D(.1845)/4, G(.2463)/2; Repeat.  \n\n\n\n\nThe notation is name(frequency)/duration, i.e. G(.2463)/4 is a quarter note G with \n\\(\\frac{2{\\pi}f}{Fs}=.2463\\)\n, which is generated by \nG4 = sin(.2463 * quarter);\n  \n\n\n\n\nGiving the notes more mnemonic names (\nG4\n for a G quarter note, \nD2\n for a D half note, etc.) should make it easier to build the tune without making errors.\n\n\n\"Repeat\" means to repeat all the notes from the beginning of the phrase (once, not recursively).  \n\n\n\n\nTo play the tune as a round, we need to add the tune to a copy of itself shifted by the length of one phrase. Since Matlab doesn't like adding vectors of different length, we will have to pad the beginning (or end) of each voice with zeros.  \n\n\nvoice1=[Tune zeros(size(phrase1))];\nvoice2=[zeros(size(phrase1)) Tune];\nsoundsc(voice1+voice2, Fs);\n\n\n\n\nA more interesting effect can be obtained by having the different voices played by different \"instruments\". If you feel up to it, make another version of the complete tune using one of the other sounds we've created (or if you don't like any of them, make up your own instrument). Then play these two voices as a round as in the previous step.",
