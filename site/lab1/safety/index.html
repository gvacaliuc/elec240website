Safety
</h1>
</center>
First the bad news:
<center>
<h3>Electricity can kill you.</h3>
</center>
How?
The two most common ways are:
<h3></h3>
<ul>
<li> by cooking you (the hard way)
<li> by disrupting your nervous system (the easy way)
</ul>
<p>
The good news is that
in ELEC 240 laboratory, you will not be exposed to
dangerous voltage levels
<em>unless</em>
you mishandle the equipment.
Before we get close enough to the equipment to mishandle it,
let's take a closer look at just how you can get hurt if you do.</p>
<h3>What strength voltages and currents are harmful?</h3>

<p>Electricity is potentially the most dangerous commodity in general use
by the public today.  In spite of this, less than 1 percent of the
100,000 accidental deaths which occur annually in the United States
are directly attributable to electrocution.  Considering the
ever-increasing use of electricity in the home and industry, we should be alert to protect and better this
excellent safety record.</p>
<p>An understanding of the effects of electric shock, high-frequency
heating, and other electrically produced physiological phenomena on the
human body should be part of basic knowledge.
We present a brief survey of these topics in the hope that
you will become aware of the very real dangers inherent in the
application of electrical phenomena.  We shall consider these dangers
in each frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum - from the power
frequencies to cosmic rays.</p>
<h4>Power Frequencies</h4>

<p>
<b>Electric Shock.</b>
The ratio of fatalities to injuries for electric shock accidents is
very high in comparison to the corresponding figure for all other
accidents.
<em>Death due to electric shock is fast and permanent.</em>

<p>
<b>Shock Sensitivity.</b>
Because of a person's highly developed nervous system,
they are sensitive to
very small currents.  For example, the tongue will give a sensation of
taste at currents as low as 45 microamperes.  The threshold of feeling
on the hand is found to be on the order of 5&nbsp;mA DC and 1&nbsp;mA at 60&nbsp;Hz.
The shocks due to currents at this threshold are usually considered
annoying rather than dangerous.  However, they are startling when not
anticipated, and may cause involuntary movement that sometimes
results in serious injury.

As the value of current increases above the threshold, one becomes
aware of sensations of heat and contraction of the muscles.  Sensations
of pain develop and voluntary control of the muscles in the path of
the current becomes increasingly difficult.  Finally a value of current
is reached where the victim "freezes" to the circuit.  The value of
current at which a victim can just release the electrode is referred
to as "let-go" current.  The average let-go current for healthy
people is about 16&nbsp;mA rms (60&nbsp;Hz).
It is important to note that let-go
currents of as low as 5&nbsp;mA have been measured.
Experience has shown
that an individual can withstand, with no ill aftereffect except for
possible sore muscles, repeated exposure to their let-go current for at
least the time required for them to release the conductor.

<p>
<b>Effect of Frequency and Waveform.</b>
Gradually increasing direct current produces sensations of internal
heating.  Sudden changes of current, however, produce powerful muscular
contractions, and interruption of the current causes very severe
shocks.  Experiments at 10&nbsp;kHz indicate that the let-go current is
approximately 3 times the 60&nbsp;Hz value.  For non-sinusoidal
waveforms, the peak value seems to be the critical factor in muscular
stimulation. 

<p>
<b>Nature of Bodily Damage.</b>
As far as gross electrical effects are concerned, the body can be
represented by the equivalent circuit shown in
the figure below.

</center>
The outer skin (epidermis) is roughly 0.1&nbsp;mm thick and has a resistance
of the order of \(10^5 \Omega /{\rm cm}^2\) when dry.  The inner skin
(dermis) and the internal organs are of relatively low resistance
because of their high salinity.
It is generally believed that the
effects of electric shock are due to the current flowing
through the body.

Electrical burns are a result of heating the skin.  The
immediate formation of blisters at the point of contact causes the
skin to lose its protective resistance and more serious damage
may thus occur.
Burns of this nature penetrate quite deeply and, while
they seldom become infected, heal very slowly.

Electrical current is most dangerous when vital organs are in its path
through the body.  Current may cause stoppage of breathing due to
excessive contraction of the chest muscles.  Temporary paralysis of
respiration may also occur if the current produces a block in the
nervous system that prevents signals from reaching the lungs.  In
either case, it is imperative that an approved form of artificial
respiration be applied immediately and continued without interruption
until competent medical examination has been made.

<p>
<b>Ventricular Fibrillation.</b>
Passage of electrical current through the heart is considered
particularly dangerous.  The heart exerts its pumping action as a
result of complex rhythmic motion controlled by periodic electrical
impulses to the muscle tissue.  The regularity of this motion assures
proper blood circulation.  Electric current passing through the heart
completely upsets this rhythmic motion and results in random muscular
contractions.  The heart no longer effectively pumps, but quivers like
so much "Jell-O".  This condition is known as ventricular
fibrillation and is nearly always fatal.
Energy of the impulse of current is responsible for this hazard and an
estimate of the danger threshold for fibrillation is 13.5&nbsp;watt-seconds.

At frequencies above the power range, the primary bodily damage results
from dielectric heating.  Heating also occurs from both conduction
current and radiation. 

The temperature of the human body is maintained remarkably constant by
very complex temperature regulating mechanisms.  These mechanisms,
coordinated by the brain, control temperature by regulating the
production and loss of heat.  Circulation of bodily fluids contributes
to the distribution of the heat.  The change in diameter of the blood
vessels, for example, regulates the volume and velocity of flow.
However, not all areas are equally well regulated, and it is possible
for local heating to occur.  Such local heating is apt to be
dangerous, particularly if vital organs are involved.  A differential
of \(5^\circ~\text{C}\)  maintained for a sufficient time may be injurious or
even lethal.
Testes, for example, undergo degenerate changes with
temperature rises as low as \(1^\circ~\text{C}\).

The amount of bodily temperature rise depends on the specific area
exposed and its efficiency of heat elimination.  Other factors
contributing to temperature rise are intensity and the duration of
exposure.  At frequencies below the microwave region \((f < 1000~\text{MHz})\),
about 40 percent of the incident energy is absorbed.  These
frequencies cause deep (internal) heating and are very dangerous:
such heating is not well indicated by sensory elements of the skin.  A
tolerance figure of \(0.001~{\rm watt}/{\rm cm}^2\) for long-term exposures has been
considered adequate.
Surface burns resulting from R.F. currents are similar to those
encountered at lower frequencies.

<p>
<h4>Microwave Frequencies</h4>
The effects of the lower microwave frequencies are similar to those of
radio frequencies and a comparable tolerance figure for exposure
should not be exceeded. 
As the frequency increases \({(f>3000~\text{MHz}})\), the incident energy is
absorbed by the skin with an efficiency of 40 to 50 percent.
The effects of such radiation are much the same as is encountered with
infrared and sunlight.

The possibility of the formation of eye cataracts must be considered
at microwave frequencies.  These cataracts result in impairment of
vision or even blindness as a result of the formation of a white cloud
in the normally transparent cornea of the eye.  Cataracts are thought
to occur in a manner analogous to the formation of the "white" of an
egg upon heating.  Experiments with rabbits have indicated that
cataracts have formed in 3 to 9 days following a single 15 minute
exposure to a 100 watt source of 12&nbsp;cm waves at a distance of 5&nbsp;cm.
While the exposure indicated here is probably extreme, care should be
taken when working with high-powered radar sets.

<p>
<h4>Infrared, Visible Light and Ultraviolet Frequencies</h4>
The immediate effects of this band of frequencies are popularly known
as sunburn.  The eye, however, is particularly susceptible to excess
exposure at these frequencies.  Such exposure can easily occur when
observing an electric arc without protection.  This may result in
hemorrhages of the choriod (the outer lining of the retina) and actual
destruction of portions of the retina itself.  In addition, actual
immediate pain may be encountered because of violent contractions
induced in the iris.  Photophthalmia (temporary snow blindness) is due
to ultraviolet radiation following undue exposure to sunlight, an
electric arc, or a sun lamp.

<p>
<h4>X-Rays and Nuclear Radiation</h4>
The effects of this portion of the electromagnetic spectrum of the
human body are still being studied.  It has been found that the amount
of energy absorbed by the tissue during exposure is the most important
consideration.  Damage to the reproductive organs has been found to be
the most sensitive indication of excessive exposure.

Controlled experiments with mice exposed to fast neutron radiation from
an atomic reactor indicate the type of damage sustained by living animals.
During the first 9 months of continuous exposure, no visible
differences were noted.  The mice then began to lose weight and
gradually lose hair.  Eye cataracts developed after a year and death
followed.  Limited exposure to nuclear radiation resulted in a
shortened life span.

We have yet to completely determine the consequences of the atomic
bombs of World War II in terms of its biological effects.  For this
reason, plus the fact that the latent period between exposure and
detection of damage may run into months and years, it behooves us to
take all precautions against X-Ray and nuclear radiation.
